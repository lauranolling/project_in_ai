A coffee dessert yes you know it's good news
When I'm with you I want to stay there
So how come no one wants me
And Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
I was made that way
'Cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Well three cool chicks
There's people standing round
tonight tonight
I told that girl that my prospects were good
If it takes me all night and day
From life to life with me
Last night I said these words to my girl
Birthday greetings bottle of wine
When you told me
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Staying in bed float up stream (float up stream)
Tuned to a natural E
so how can I get tired of you?
Hide your head in the sand little girl
And for all the little piggies life is getting worse
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
And I'd really like to go
(Roll up) to make a reservation
Oh yeah only I know oh I loose baby
Now now now now
Now today I find
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
I don't mind I could wait for ever I've got time
Hey hey (bop shuop m'bop bop shuop)
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
A rockin' in two by two oh
can't help it
Mr City policeman
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing
Some kind of solitude measured out in you
you better leave my kitten all alone
If you don't want any of those peaches honey please don't mess around my tree
Please please me oh yeah like I please you you
Knows not where he's going to
But I'm like that northwest Mountie
I saw the light
If I could forget her
And leave you flat
Holding you feel so glad so baby oh baby
Well if you ever ever say goodbye
to each other by love?
I can't talk to people that I meet
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Hey man
Things went bad I met her dad he said:
Sha la la la la la la la
You know if you break my heart
Come on come on come on
hair down to his knee
Home safely to me
I'd do it to you
It is no surprise now what you see is me
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey) and you
May I inquire discreetly
I told you about the walrus and me man
I feel so suicidal
Well do you don't you want me to love you
But it's not always going to be this grey
You think she needs you
To save your doggone soul
goog goog g'joob
I got a chance I ought to take it
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
You think I'm soft in the head
Bright are the stars that shine
She once had me
he never ever learned to read or write a book so well
Slow down baby now you're movin' way too fast
You're gonna say you love me too oh
your Teddy boy's here taking good care of you
Take out some insurance on me baby ooo some goddamn insurance on me baby
Getting nowhere on our way back home
Honey disconnect the phone
Don't need to be alone
yeah that's all right mama just anyway you do
in the way we went out
Think of what I'm saying
she thinks of him
walrus gumboot he got
Then there was music and wonderful roses
Just call on me
I want to tell you I feel hung up and I don't know why
Waiting for your knock dear on my old front door
don't you be very long
And III waited for your kiss
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
Until I do I'm hoping
If you don't take her out tonight she's going to change her mind
Five six seven eight nine ten
oo much monkey business for me to be involved again
I'm not that kind of man
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
She's well acquainted with the touch
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
You think you lost your love
I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna love you more and more every way
and I do and I do and I do
She's so good looking but she looks like a man
drop me a line
When the sun shines
Your Mother should know
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
waiting waiting
But you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle
I get my fill
In Liverpool she even dare to critize the Beatles' hair
I won't be late again
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
 Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
And if you say the word
Standing on the cast iron shore yeah
Mine for evermore
I get high with a little help from my friends
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
baby please please please
Wait wait mister postman
(One two) (One two three four)
It's been a long time now I'm coming back home
Sittin' down by the rhythm review
I'm just like a string feeling
I often wonder what you're thinking of
Go go go little Queenie
Gonna rock it up
Tell me that you want the kind of things
Yes she is yes she is
Yeah I've got a feeling
Since you left me I'm so alone
'Cos my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall
If you ever say goodbye
Just the sight of you makes night time bright
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
When the band starts to play
I said we're traveling on the One after NineO
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well you know We all want to change the world
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
everyone's saying it
Ohoh that'll be the day
Well you call me your baby when you're holding my hand
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Is just hold me hold me hold me hold me
Where I know that I am free
Sweet little sixteen she's just got to have about half a million framed autopraphs
You knew I wanted just to hold you
To try our best to hold it there with our love
Please come back to me I'm lonely as can be
Now junior behave yourself
You tell me that it's evolution
Go and count a ring or two
and then you'll be the lonely one
You'll never know it hurt me so
Stepping outside she is free
like an arrow piercing through it
When I held you near you were so sincere
you don't come my way
But her eyes they tantalize
Yes I know that this is the night
you're back again
Just like little girls and boys
she only played one night stands now
You'll let me hold your hand
'Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
Say the word and you'll be free
I kind of like you just the way you are
mm mm hello little girl
If you won't see me you won't see me
Love you every day girl
Sgt Pepper's Lonely
Your lips are moving I cannot hear
I saw you walk in your door
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
However big you think you ar
For red is the color that will make me blue
Standing in the English rain
wondering what you're gonna do
while I'm trying to do my bit
You're always there
Hey baby yeah you thrill me so
to each other by love
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm an old poor boy I'm a long way from home
yeyeyeah
I roll a stoney
hanging by the home
(Roll up) for the Mystery Tour
I'm not trying to steal your vest
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzie oh girl you look so fine
I would remember all the things we planned
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
When your bird is broken
Every dime that he get is lost to the jukebox man
She will turn to me and start to cry
I'm really sorry for your ageing head
Honey pie hello
Doing the garden digging the weeds
Yeah love me do
Alright hey hey hey hey
Good day sunshine
Were you telling lies (on the night before)?
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
No I get by with a little help from my friends
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I can't forget the spell that I'm in
They'd laugh in my face
Turn my face to the wall
Picture yourself on a train in a station
And it's my mind
But nobody wants to know him
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
Make your mother sigh
You're the one I love
Well don't you know I can't take it?
Someone like you
Try to save our romance!
we hope you have enjoyed the show
And the angels ask me to recall
I'm looking through you and you're nowhere
Before she gets to saying goodbye
Oh me oh my
The way you rock and roll
Darling when you're near
I won't want to stay
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
They'd seen his face before
When you're lonely
Oo in misery
If you'll only listen to my pleas
You you you
You never give me your money
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors
There's a place
Bom bom bom bompa bom sail the ship
I'm back in the car
We'll do the twist the stomp
Got it
here comes the sun
I feel good in a special way
What am I
Then you begin
That's all I do
mm mm mm You're my little girl
Yes you can syndicate any boat you row
That is confusing things
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
where lives a young country boy named Johnny B Goode
You say you got a real solution
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
There there's a place
(Roll up) satisfaction guaranteed
Oo baby I don't it's silly but I'm glad all over
But they are they just play it like that
But I need a break
another girl
Dream sweet dreams for me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
I've got arms that long to hold you
You can't do that
My love is something you can't reject
Made her look a little like a military man
Well She's the woman who's got that beat
That's it! That's it man!
You're going to lose that girl you're going to lose that girl
And in time you'll understand the reasons why
Never be the lonely one
Oh look out She came in through the bathroom window
Well I'll say bye bye bye baby bye bye
I've got something I can laugh about
For I know love will never die
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden with you
We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found
But when the pain cuts through you're going to know and how
Yes it's true
Hey hey (bop shuop)
You never wear a suit of lace
Each one believing that love never dies
Well she needs no coachin' on makin' love
Dear what can I do?
That's the end ah little girl
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
I can change it round
But I need you
How could she say to me
Oh yeah
bye bye bye bye bye
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
What does he care?
For if I ever saw you
But as from today well I've seen somebody that's new
To say about the things that you do
Get a home settle down by the book
These are words that go together well
They bought and sold you
Da da da da da dum dum dum
I won't upset the apple cart
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
You're just a rocking and a rolling Ooo I said I wish you were mine ah
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
We hope you will enjoy the show
And the night
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Because you're sweet and lovely girl I love you
She's in the mood no need to break it I got a chance I ought to take it
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
I grab my baby tried to give her a squeeze
They had to count them all
But I can't break away from all of these
But the way you deceive me I just don't understand
They were right I was wrong
I've just seen a face
Told her I would really like to see her again
Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Got to get you into my life
You know you made me cry
 Gonna let you down and leave you flat
I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong
Having been some days in preparation a splendid time is guaranteed for all
So he waits behind
Well well well you're feeling fine
Keep all my love forever
So she can hear my man awail a sax
Is bringing her down yeah
There is one thing I am sure of
so you'll understand
(I saidwoof!)
In this way Mr K will challenge the world
We said our goodbyes (on the night before)
Well if you want me baby mm you got to come to me
You gave me the word
Why should it be so much to ask of you
I guess nobody ever really done me
I got to find my baby I declare there ain't no lie
And they ain't the kind that you can see
She's gonna tear your heart apart
when the sun shines
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
Well let me tell you well no chick made could be the same as Sweet Georgia Brown
Aw the hippy hippy shake
Not too long a ride You take your car along
Ask a policeman on the street
Wo wo yeah heh yeah oh yeah
Monday I'm gonna talk
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
I know this love of mine
I never give you my pillow
You're makin' me (shout)
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
I then look at you all
Come in out of the cold
I need somebody to love
Please don't be long
Glimmering In the sun
Baby it's you
Well now you shake it to the left
I can't stop my brain
exactly where my life will go
Or you won't know where I am
You can't hear me
I will love her forever
All of my life
Everyone you see is full of life
I'll be round
If I grow up I'll be a singer
And so I quit the police department
I don't know how you were inverted
But if it's seen
If she's gone I can't go on
I told you about the fool on the hill
Suddenly
Of the beginning of the beginning
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out
So I'm telling you my friend
yeah yeah lord
 Well you went up and married but I love you still
I never weep at night I call your name
I'll say I love you and I'm always thinking of you
No one will be watching us
We all live in a yellow submarine
Take me to your daddy's farm
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Lifting latches on our way back home
Lay down your arms of love and surrender to me
Ruby Ruby Ruby will you be mine sometime? Alright now
All my loving darling I'll be true
just like I need you
And all I have to do is think of her
Too much too much too muchaFADE
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me
Help! You know I need someone
that some day well I'll be through
I'll get you in the end
play it how I may
That grow so incredibly high
Still my guitar gently weeps
oh yesterday came suddenly
Well Bebopalula
You know I love you
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
Teddy turned and ran oh far away oh yeah
Another road where maybe I
And though he'll never come back
If it's a slow song we'll omit it
I said something wrong now I long
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Sexy Sadie oooh you broke the rules
Oh so long
When they get a crowd
And he never gives an answer
I'll make you maybe next time around
And if it's good she'll admit it
Before I got home I had nineteen dates
And you're gone
Still you don't regret a single day
And the night you don't come my way
Running to and fro hard working at the mill
Heard before when you gave me no reply
Maybe some day your name will be in light saying:
another kind of mind there
Maxwell stands alone
Her home is on the south side just beyond the ridge
She said she'd always been a dancer
s leaving (We didn't know it was wrong)
Can I bring my friend to tea
as Mr Kite flies through the ring
and all your turtle doving
I know I'll let you down
Feel like I wanna (shout)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
She said that living with me
I have always thought that it's a crime
You rule this world with me I'm the sheik of Araby
Fixing a hole in the ocean
it'll suit you just fine
Well that's all right mama that's all right for you
Please stop your lying you've got me crying girl
There was love all around
died in the church and was buried along with her name
Black white green red
Dying to take you away
He says he has the blues but he has a lotta fun
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Because the wind is high
If you only knew how much I love you why can't you love me again?
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
What do you want not be and have you travelled very far
where do they all belong?
Don't let it carry you away
Dear Prudence let me see you smile
I'm miles away
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
she's gonna see me coming
It's not the first time that it's happened to me
Money don't get everything it's true
Until setting be in a left hand
You look tired
Then she cried oh my
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
Boy – you're gonna carry that weight Carry that weight a long time
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Oh baby baby baby blues and sorrow
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Like a homing bird I fly
Well get out of that kitchen
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird
all your hugs and kisses and your money too
From my girlfriend so far away
For you only
does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Let's all get up and dance to a song that was a hit
So I hope you see
We were strolling along (twist and shout!)
Gather round all you clowns
I don't know who can
Tho' he may want you too
Who knows baby You may comfort me
We're Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band
Come on Queenie let's shake it
Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet
People running round it's five o'clock
So please don't ever change
That money just can't buy
I wanna go but I hate to leave you
Until then I'll cry instead
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
PC thirtyone said we've caught a dirty one
You know you should be glad
But when she says she loves you that means a lot
your mind aches
If you really like it you can have the rights
I said who put all those things in your head
Any Jobber got the sack
I think it's only fair
When I feel low
You know my name that's right look up the number
The farther one travels
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
she's good to me
please don't you be very long
Oh ain't she sweet
So patiently
Big man yeah walking in the park
stupid bloody Tuesday
I will
Some day you'll know I was the one
Strawberry Fields forever
I'm in love and it's sunny day
So I want to be a paperback writer
A four of fish and finger pies
Sorry that I doubted you I was so unfair
All thru' the day
Well if you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Even those tears
Who'll screw you in the ground
Make all my dreams come true
If you're lonely you can talk to me (yeah!)
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
Oh oh Ruby Ruby how I want ya
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and dew
You you know you know my name You you know you know my name
Believe me darling
who ever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancy
Oh you
Ooh she do me
Ah Ah Ah Ah
I have to admit it's getting better
Don't ya know I mean boys
You'll let me be your man
Tell my father (heyayayay)
wish I knew how you do it to me
I thought I'd never miss her
Martha my dear
Obladi Oblada life goes on bra
It's a clean machine
Sonny if you want it here it is come and get it
to you I must be sure
Ooh I need your love babe guess you know it's true
yeah you got that something
But it's no joke
I know she isn't
come again please here
When you're passing on your way
I'm a givin' you the warnin'
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good and he know he could
Now I need a place to hide away
Come and keep your comrade warm
And I've been working like a dog
How do I feel by the end of the day are you sad because you're on your own
I am he
Like pigs in a sty
If she'll dance we can make it Come on Queenie let's shake it
Finally made the plane into Paris
my oh my that country boy can play
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
I said we're only trying to get us some peace
I'm gonna walk right down that street like Bulldog Drummon
You and me burning matches
I've got no business being here with you this way
I've never been happy cause everything I ever did was wrong
What a shame Mary Jane
boy Back in the car
Oh Oh now I can see you be you
Without her I will be in misery
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
Sexy Sadie what have you done
They say that everyone want someone
So forget the other boys 'cos my love is real come off your battlefield
Come on and twist a little closer now (twist a little closer)
Who could ask for more
hello hello
Don't you know that you can count me out
As I walked along the road
I'll make a point of taking her away from you yeah
I would hate for my disappointment to show
I told you about strawberry fields
A little cutie takes your hat
for other girls were never quite like this
She will never make me jealous
Another girl who will love me till the end
Well I've got a woman
You know on
Just look into my eyes
She loves you yeah yeah yeah
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Would always feel the same
Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes?
Doesn't have a point of view
Love love me do
I'm in love with you oo
Sweet wind we must borrow
and make love It don't take much luck to see what I've got
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
You can't cry 'cos you're laughing at me
All I do is hang my head and moan
That when I tell you that I love you oh
But your lovin' don't pay my bill
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
I'm sure to fall in love with you
Like no other can
He'll regret it somedayiay
So I sing a song of love
You'll never leave and you know it's true
Aaahhh boys
Do you promise not to tel Whoa
Roll up for the Mystery Tour
Maybe you'd understand
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
She's the queen of all the team
I love you more than ever girl I do
IIII should never never never be blue
She tells me all the time
I will return yes I will return
And our friends are all aboard
way across town
Buy buy
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gotta check it and see one more time for me
You never seem to see me standing there
Bungalow Bill
Hey bulldog
'cos I'm so blue and lonely
This time I will try to show that
Now the moon begins to shine
She's sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few
We've been friends for oh so long
All together now:
In spite of all the heartache that you may cause me
Wo baby baby
I never weep at night I can't go on
The kiss my lover brings
What are you doing to my life?
And he never shows his feelings
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Your lovin' give me a thrill
It's just a state of mind
Anytime at all
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo
We're sorry but it's time to go
She ought to do right by me
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
I'll be on my way hey
Oo Oo
for yesterday
and I will set you free
Ain't that perfection?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
I got something to say that might cause you pain
For tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
Well you see me in misery
You've tried before to leave me but you never had the nerve
Every night
You're waiting for someone to perform with
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
Hey little little
I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Only to find Gideon's Bible
I said I'm traveling on the One after NineONine
Well I said I'm traveling on the One after NineONine
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Ring my friend I said you'd call Doctor Robert
I'm making sure that I'm not late
We'd meet again for I had to hold you
Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
Oh since I saw her standing there
It's getting better since you've been mine
Do you say goodbye
Love is all you need
You say you're gonna leave you know it's a lie 'cos that'll be the day when I die
I do mean you
For fussing and fighting my friend
aah Johnny B Goode!
Till we found the sea of green
Something in the way she woos me
Happy ever after in the market place
Wo wo ho ho I'm atalkin' to you right now hey! Ow!
How was I to know you would upset me
And your feet start amovin' around
I just need somebody to love
Working for peanuts is all very fine
So how come no one loves me
And if you ever even try
Understand it's true
You know my name that's right look up my number
We are together now and forever come my way
Waiting waiting it seems so useless
With a couple of kids running in the yard
So why on earth should I moan
So gimme money
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
Yes it's so hard loving you oh
It took me years to write will you take a look
I think it's me
when I was around
You know you twist your little girl (twist little girl)
My hearts beatin' rhythm
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I'll make love to you
Your outside is in and your inside is out
I'll do anything for you
Just sees what he wants to see
guess you know it's true
My friend works with the National Health Doctor Robert
I said even though you know what you know
Talkin' 'bout (heyayayay)
I've got a feeling a feeling I can't hide
I'd hate to miss the train
Well you never done nothing
Happy birthday to you
Know how to love me
All the things that you should
I think it's today yeah
And I'll be there
In the evening wanna die
So please love me do
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Wanna die yeah wanna die
Oughta see 'em reel an rock
Not worrying what they or you say
deep in the heart of Texas on down the Frisco Bay
it's all right
Wait oh yes wait a minute mister postman
Been to Yokohama baby fighting in the war
Oh sitting and aplaying in the shade
Got me escaping from this zoo
And now the time has come so my love I must go
And I'll try not to sing out of key
To love me like I love you
Oh keep your hands off my baby she's mine
I need to
By the time I count from one to four
Love you with all my heart
You don't look different but you have changed
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
I saw the photograph
I guess I would die sweetheart if I don't get a kiss from you
The men from the press
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
I need to make you see
I'm the kind of guy who never used to cry
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
I could tell the world a thing or two about our love
Well they took some honey from a tree
How I love you
I give her all my love
The deeper you go the higher you fly
That I would love to love you
Just to dance with you is everything I need
And tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill
These days such a kind girl seems so hard to find
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
soldier of love baby lay down your arms
I said move over once move over twice
Well his mama told him: someday you will be a man
I want you at the moment I feel blue
Cool cherry cream and nice apple tart
I'd love to turn you on
I like to be with you
See the gal with the diamond ring
oo oo oo
Go with him
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
a mind can blow those clouds away
Oh yeah to know know know her
I'd rather see you dead little girl
Hold your head up you silly girl look what you've done
The only difference is you're down there
Please say it to mommy it's alright with you
With love from us to you
and every day it sure lets out
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
So many days you passed me by
You know you twist so fine (twist so fine)
And in the middle of investigation I break down
No matter where she's hiding
But I gotta get a belly full of wine
Well she's got no time fora dungeries
You're asking me will my love grow

Bebopalula
So won't you please come home
My arms are holding you
If the sun has faded away
I'm glad it's your birthday

I'm atrying to forget these lonesome tears in my eyes
I'm telling you
Ruby Ruby Ruby will you be mine sometime?

In my way (talkin' about you)
Searching every which away
Julia Julia oceanchild calls me
What can I do what can I be?
I've been away now oh how I've been alone
I forgot to remember to forget
Can't you see yeah
Not guilty and I'm not here for the rest
She knows how to do it all night long
Can you hear me can you hear me?
Tell the truth now is love real?
All thru' your life
Hold tight tap your foot
Anna Girl before you go now
Help me get my feet back on the ground
You better slow down!
Oh I love you
I'm growing wild
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
I don't mind I think they're crazy
I can make it longer if you like the style
For goodness sake
you say low (you say low)
We were pulled apart because her mom would not agree
At the star and so
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
I never would try to tell you just why
da da dee dee dee
Many more of them live next door
Writing letters on my wall
And kept my mind from wandering
One more heartache is all I can use
But it's all wrong
free as a bird
'Cos I'm the Taxman
Well Sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
We're gonna have a good time
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Rocky bust in and grinning a grin
we will sing a little song for you
Treat me like you did the night before
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
Things that make feel that I'm mad
But I never heard it singing
Some other guy now has taken my love just like I'm gone oh now
because we love you
 I've caught you talking to him
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Please believe me when I tell you
When I was younger so much younger than today
every night the tears come down from my eyes
Such a mean old man such a mean old man
But when I get home to you
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
I'm going insane
And if you leave me
Rain I don't mind
If you take a walk
She says that long ago she knew someone but now
Me I'm just a lucky kind
Oh I believe in yesterday
early warning he got
Well you can indicate everything you see
I see no use in wondering why
And when I see your smile replacing every thoughtless frown
Well that's all right my mama anyway you do
A love like ours
The love that's shining all around here
There was love all around But I never heard it singing
And since I lost you it feels like years
Please don't spoil my day
yes I'm gonna be a star
I've got my bag Run right home
Just call on me and I'll send it along
For people and things that went before
Some other guy now has taken my love away from me oh now
Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good and he knew he could
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
Lived a man who sailed the sea
I'll call on you
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured
And all the people that come and go
Come on come on come on come on
Falling in love again
I don't know why she's riding so high
That taste of honey tasting much sweeter than wine
Yes I ask you very confidentially
I've got the shake
And if their wings burn I know I'm not to blame
Come on I'm on my way
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
How often have you been there often enough to know
wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Well let me be your little dog till your big dog comes
Standing over by the record machine
But three cool chicks made three fools out of three cool cats
With all the vantage you had
To miss that love is something I'd hate
Oh baby come on
While the music will treat you
She feels good she knows she's looking fine
Blue mist round my soul
Well each time I see you waving my heart cries
she's the latest and the greatest of them all
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
Tell my mother (heyayayay)
And you know that this don't apply to you
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal
aw the hippy hippy shake
Home home and dry
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
Oh yeah why do you make me blue
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
Sunday morning creeping like nun
All I gotta do
I'll tax the heat
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
Sue sue mailman that will do for sometime
Inside a letter box they
but you know baby it's getting late
And in my hour of darkness
Baby hurry now don't keep me worry no
oh the hippy hippy shake
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
Hey you've got to hide your love away
On Tuesday I'm gonna talk
Havin' me some fun tonight
to make it better
Hey hey hey hey hey baby you're no clown
Who ever thought I'd be
crying crying
Nothing is real
you you!
you'd better leave my daughter alone
To be a minute over seventeen
 Did you think that money was heaven sent?
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
Make straight for the shore
When you've seen beyond yourself
Get back to where you once belonged
And proceeded to lie on the table
Don't ask me what I want it for (Taxman Mister Wilson)
she took me half the way there
a bird on wing
A crazy stop
take Obladi Oblada
Well I saw her yesterday yi yay
Just jump around and reel and rock it
And I love you tomorrow
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
Hey come on oh come on
I looked into you eyes and
Don't take chances if your romance is
'Cos I told you once before goodbye
She got a crazy partner
 And then she said
she wouldn't say
Love is all love is you
Then came the day she found herself a man
That you may see the meaning of within
And so all the night
Kindly send her sailing back to me
But it all works out
Ow! if you want our love to last
It's time for tea and meet the wife
but Still they lead me back to the long winding road
And now she is mine
And though the holes were rather small
baby you been slipping around so aw aw
Not guilty for leading you astray
Had you come some other day then it might not have been like this
Watching the skirts start to flirt now you're in gear
The little children laugh at him behind his back
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Sitting here
I think about you night and day
Me used to be angry young man
With a love like that
Hey Jude begin
Oh tell me what'd say
Nobody wants me
The long and winding road that leads to your door
The eagle picks my eye
gonna find her
my darling lend me your comb
Till he's seen you cry hi hi
Hope you need my love babe
Will never die
Mm mm
You got that sand all over your feet so aw aw
I want to tell you
everybody saw the sunshine
Every hour of the day
You'll be mine
tight yeah
I was alone
That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead
Till I thinking of her
I don't hear it
You don't want my lovin' anymore
Well you know that I love you more than anyone can
She showed me her room
I'd try to make you sad somehow
want that little chick
It's such a feeling That my love I can't hide
I nearly broke down and cried
What I have done to deserve such a fate
Tell me that you love me baby
If I give my heart
If I'd been out till quarter to three
As long as I
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
Well she's my baby 'cos she's understands
you're not the same
I know what it is to be sad
All together now
bompa bom Chop the tree
Father McKenzie
Hey Jude you'll do
I know no one can do me no harm
and I found that love was more
She asked me to stay and she told me sit anywhere
Crazy feet that dance so neat has sweet Georgia Brown
In conversation
When I'm home everything seems to be right
while you're the one
when you'll say
Yeah I'm gonna searching searching every which away yeah yeah
Love me before I grow too old
We'd like to take you home with us
Well I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
And your fingers start apoppin'
I'll tax your feet
In every way
And you've got time to rectify
Oh won't you give me some loving
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Don't want you by the race get away and leave me
when I say hello
Hey baby if you're all alone
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
And her lowneck sweater
Maggie Mae
I saw a film today oh boy
and someday you're gonna see
You know my name ba ba ba ba look up the number
And the jukebox's blowin' a fuse
Sing it loud so I can hear
I'm not goin' to make it
I'll look after you like I've never done before
The queen was in the parlor
everybody had a wet dream
It's real love it's real
Gonna roll it up
You're my honey
Could never die
Would it be too much to ask of you
The world was waiting just for you
she coming from out of Bahran
You do me wrong now
I'll keep all the others from knocking at your door
Butterflies
I'm counting on you
Sit back and let the evening go Sgt Pepper's lonely
And nobody cares if she's long and tall
you better leave you better leave
You're the devil in a frying pan
Chains my baby's got me locked up in chains
Ooh girl you know the reason why
But you see now I'm too much in love
You know I love you still
Yes I admit it's getting better
 but as it is I'll dream of her
When you're listening late at night
It's got a back beat you can't lost it
All things must pass
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
And she said listen babe I've got something to say
Don't hide the tears that don't show
Have you near me
Why she's too cute
Lady Madonna children at your feet
I hope that you won't mind
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
I think you're fine
All these places had their moments
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight
A crowd of people stood and stared
Do you believe in love at first sight
Gets a thrill through her fingertips
They can see he's just a fool
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Some have gone and some remain
 Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
If I were you I'd realize
You came to me one summer night
Hela hebo helloa
Yes that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Look in my direction
Everybody's trying to be my baby now
I want you I want you so bad babe
love was such an easy game to play
No mummy's arms to hold me or sooth me when I cry
I get high when I see you go by
You'll be older too
If I ain't dead already
And she'll go sailing no more
For just a card or just a letter
So I hope there'll come a day
You know it's three weeks
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette
and three cool cats really fell in love
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside the zoo
If you start to dance and sing
But I'll be back again someday
I want you for the rest of my life
What do you say? '
Well ever since the day that she said we were through
Lend me your comb
In her direction
A friend says that a love is never true
Well here's something for you to do
I mean 'er yes'
What goes on in your heart
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
But as the words are leaving his lips a noise comes from behind
You have broken my heart (oh twist and shout!)
Possessing and caressing me
No reply no reply
But I never saw them winging
Always shine
Roll over Beethoven
Well I got a baby crazy for me
All day Wednesday I'm gonna talk
Railman says you've got the wrong location
One thing I can say girl
waiting for you
She's knows a woman's place right back there
She's not a girl who misses much
with that hippy hippy shake
Michelle ma belle
She is standing right in front of me
When you're by my side
Just like I knew you would (like I knew you would)
 Because I told you before oh
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Help me get in touch with her in Memphis Tennesse
She says she loves you
The music will never stop
If you think the harmony
When I look into your eyes
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
I'll get to you somehow
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I deserve
And from the first time that she really done me
Ain't no doubt about it this must be love
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
You're thinking of me the same old way
Prr prr you know my name and the number
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
I'll be coming home again to you love
I'm right Where I belong
All over Saint Louis and down in New Orleans
In case of accidents he always took his mom
We're on our way home
This boy
What it don't get I can't use
Sun sun sun
How could she do this to me
I hear the clock aticking on the mantelshelf
it's time to go home
Give me more hey hey give me more
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Was I so unwise (on the night before)?
You're correct there's nobody there
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
You'll see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Christ! You know it ain't easy
it's up to you
he walrus was Paul
I only give you my situation
Why why are we so far apart?
'cos I know my whole life's gonna be one solid mess
You told me oh yes you told me
baby Say you're driving me insane
How can you laugh
Whenever I want you around yeah
Well searching
That boy won't be happy
If I needed someone to love
Honey honey honey honey said get off of that money
I love you madly
I me mind
I've been alone and I have
When she says she loves you that means a lot
She's gone to his head
It's a rockin' little record
Hey man save one chick for me
It doesn't matter much to me
Believe me when I tell you
That's what I want
Oh how long will it take
boy Back in the US
I call your name
'Cos you dance so good
I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
I tell you man he's living there still
Good night good night everybody
But when she turns her back on the boy he creeps up from behind
you'll come back
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
Wowuwa! Ah!
I said to my soul
And what's more it's true
And I'll be kissing you
And then while I'm away
Attracts me like no other lover
yeah I'm gonna Kansas City coming to get my baby back home yeah
Jojo left his home in Tucson Arizona
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
And IIII
And my soul keeps singing the blues
I tell you just why you know I don't lie
I don't have much to say
Back in the car
I said honey honey honey honey get off of that money
Protected by a silver spoon
You can make it OK
Oh oh 'cos I'm happy just to dance with you
Yes it is it's true
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
The man with the foolish grin
No no nay will she deceive
Nobody ever loved me like she does
But you're the only love that I've ever had
Just a rocking and a rolling
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
You love me to
you you you you
And when I awoke
Sexy Sadie ooh what have you done
His son is working for the Daily Mail
You know the place where nothing is real
Some other guy now has taken away my sweet desire oh now
It is knowing it is knowing
The Magical Mystery Tour is dying to take you away
You know I'd give you everything I've got
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Then you can start
You know that I need you
Look up my number
bye bye bye
Ono sideboard he one
yeah you better leave you better leave
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
I just want your loving arms around me yeah
I don't take what I don't want
I'm looking through you
Everytime you do well I feel glad all over
As you are he
Looking through the bent backed tulips
Working overtime
You are tearing me apart
Will she still believe it when he's dead? Ah girl girl
she turns him down
I know it's wrong to keep on
But now the tide is turning
Or the sound he appearss to make
I remember too a distant bell
Oh I repeat
I'll go but I'll be back again
It's easy 'cos I know
Hold them tight then
'Cos I really can't stand it
You and me Sunday driving
we've met Mm mm
When you mess with the girl I love
don't mean maybe
But can you show me where you are
You're such a lovely audience
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Ain't agonna tell you one more time
But you see now I'mm too much in love
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
And go where you're going to
Now Ruby Ruby Ruby will you be mine sometime?
See the tear standing in my eye
I'm sure to fall fall in love
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
My love don't give me no presents
What can I do when it's true
'Cos I couldn't stand the pain
Eight days a week
I told you so all I want is you
We got to go home
I can't over you oh baby oh
that you may cause me
He said Rocky you met your match
And I'd rather see you dead
Helter skelter helter skelter Helter skelter
na na na na
Ooh she done me
The love I crave I can't find no more
Hey hey you better leave
I'm not half the man I used to be
But let's dance well let's dance
I feel fine
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Tell them I remember
Because she loves
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
She came along to turn on everyone
In the land of submarines
Here come old flattop he come
Don't run and hide
II saw a girl in my dreams
now go and get her
let it be let it be
The movement you need is on your shoulder
I mean to show everybody the light
And you looked alone
And the same goes for me whenever you want me at all
You know you know my name
It's been a long lonely time and it's funny funny to see
if the rain comes
your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
But I'll be back again
To know know know her is to love love love her
 Well Lucille baby do your sister's will
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last
All I can hear
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel when it's real
And you shake
Yes I know I'm a lucky guy
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
You tell lies thinking I can't see
All that I was looking for was somebody
She's coming down fast
and I lost someone who's near to me
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
And if somebody loved me
And with a love like that
You know you look so good (look so good)
yeah she looks like the model
but I may mean no no no
No one I think is in my tree
I got to go past
No no not a second time
Carve your number on my wall
when you burnt that toast the other morning I
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Becomes so excited oh watch her at the run boy
I tried to walk but I was lame
Oh wu you you know you know my name
Oh yeah alright
Working in the filling station too many tasks
the powder's not on your face
Don't you know that it's so
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I don't know why you say goodbye
Yeah I want you I want you so bad babe
searching every which away
We're here to sing for you
Come on if you please I've got no time for trivialities
says she's all right
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
Soon it will be the break of day
Forever on and forever forever on side by side
Now it's past my bed I know
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
I think I'll love you too
Got to be goodlooking 'cause he's so hard to see
Look at him working
That is I think I disagree
I had no real good loving since that woman said goodbye
Man do you see what I see?
Do do do do do do do do
Baby you're a rich man
Take a drink from his special cup Doctor Robert
mm you're my little girl
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there
go go go little Queenie
Living is easy with eyes closed
We can work it out We can work it out
No I never heard them at all 'Til there was you
Dressed in her polythene bag
You are too much ah!
Go round my head
When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
Ah Kansas City coming to get my baby on time yeah
If the sun don't come you get a tan from
where we just met
the smiles returning to their faces
I'm so sad and lonely
Dressed it up and they called it me
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit
What a bundle of joy
In
But you left me sitting on my own
The duchess of Kirkcaldy always smiling
My pappie told me there'd be times like these
Your touch sewed me like an electric wire
When I'm home feeling you holding me Tight
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot
Help! Not just anybody
I'm gonna hide myself awayayhay
when I was a boy everything was right
E F G H I J
I've tried to telephone
making friends with every Sikh
Trying to save paper
Let me tell you about a girl I know
Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone
Then each little dream will take wings
You don't get me
like I've never done
I'll be here yes I will whenever you call
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
She says: baby everything is alright
from the very start
you're the one that I'd be thinking of
You layed it down for all to see
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she
no no no no
And my life would be through
Though you've gone away this morning you'll be back again tonight
Noone else can make you change
I have had enough so act your age
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Is it right that you and I should fight
your pappie will shout
I'm the lonely one
She was a girl in a million my friend
Yellow submarine yellow submarine
Listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
Then they say that everyone needs someone
Tell my brother (heyayayay)
I'll live and love and maybe some day
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
And that's enough to make you mine girl
Well I talk about boys
Can't buy me love
You find the joint is jammed
There's one for you nineteen for me
Spending someone's hard earned pay
And it doesn't really matter if I'm wrong
If you and me should get together
She catch Patagonian pancake with that one a gin party makes
Red sails in the sunset
(Play it now play that instrument)
And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make
She wrote me only one sad night
Seems like all I really was doing was waiting for you
Don't pay money just to see yourself with Doctor Robert
That the singer's going to sing a song
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
On the cover of a magazine
Why she had to go I don't know
You gotta wait a minute wait a minute
I get shy when they start to stare
To shoot off the legs of his rival
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
I need you 'cos it's true
And though she thought I knew the answer
And when I ask you to be mine
Get back get back
Da da
You know what I mean
The sun is up the sky is blue
Hallelujah I just love that chick so
When I get near you
Because like a rolling stone
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
fifty women knocking on my door
Yes you shake
with hurry homedrops on her cheek that trickled from her eyes
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundramat
I beg her for kisses on my bended knees
And I need a job
Talkin' 'bout you
Getting so much better all the time
Well you can imitate everyone you know
They say they say you never never never ever heard of being true
Unless we come
that I Love you more than any other guy
A lots of other girls I've seen
But every now and then I feel so insecure
If you want it anytime I can give it
Here comes the sun
oh oh yeah
To be there and everywhere
Can I take my friend to bed
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
I get the wiggles in my knee
Oh her lips are really thrilling
Yes I will
Julia Julia seashell eyes windy smile calls me
I've got the sun in my heart and my heart's in the sun
Get back Loretta
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Nobody but you
The worm he licks my bone
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
I could be handy mending a fuse
I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade
You better take yourself home
You may be awoken
Yes I'm lonely wanna die
like I've never done before!
deep in the heart of Texas and down the Frisco Bay
I don't expect to take your heart
they know how to treat guys mean
I'm in love but I'm lazy
 You can't do that
Well I knew what I could not say
Say the word love
Flew in from Miami Beach
Yes it is yes it is
I told that girl I could start right away
But you can't see me
Well honey don't I say
See the gal with the red dress on
He knows that they're the fools
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Running everywhere at such a speed
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
Tell me why?
And you park it outside
With your short and hairy legs
Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
I sit alone at home and I cry
I wanna be your man
sitting pretty little policeman in a row
Is it for her or myself that I cry
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
With voices out of nowhere
To help with good Rocky's revival
Say the word I'm thinking of
Aah searching searching oh my my goodness
When she no longer needs you
Wearing diamond and rings
I'll pretend I am kissing
Silly girl
(How can you laugh?)
I don't care if I spent my dough
See that I'm always
I tried to follow her all the way home
What did you see when you were there nothing that doesn't show
please don't come near
things will change and you'll be mine
Let me tell you how it will be
Try thinking more
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Wahhoo!
She's cool oh
Your love in there for me
Baby won't you tell me why why why why are we so far apart?
Open up your eyes now tell me what you see It is no surprise now what you see is me
The more I learn the less I know
Something in the way she knows
I want you to know now
I took one look and I was fractured
everything was right
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
All thru' the night
But she was another man
I can't hide
I'm looking through you you're not the same
and she'll never walk down Lime Street anymore
You're only fooling around you're fooling around with me
Say the words you long to hear
And I do and I do and I do
Many years from now
Last night is the I will remember you by
Everybody's trying to be my baby
rom me If I needed someone
Julia sleeping sand silent cloud touch me
Well honey don't
girl I like your face
Go home
Shaves in the dark
Anytime inside of me any more
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
But what is sweet now turns so sour
tears keep afalling all night long
Take a sad song
Clutching her handkerchief
I love you when you're happy
Tell me you understand
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her
I do all the pleasing with you
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
You'd better run for your life if you can little girl
I may appear to be imperfect
Whoo! That's it! You got it!
You been out painting the town Uh huh
Well come into my machine
but it's okay
You can't see me
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
If you don't want to pay some more (Taxman Mister Heath)
'cos that'll be the day when I die
I could stay with you
See how they snied
a song of love for Julia Julia Julia
If you want me to – I will
I do a road hog
Ah Kansas City coming to get my baby back home yeah
It feels so right now feels so right now
When I think of that she told
I think cool cats really did flip
It's much it's much
'Cos I know where you've been
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
I want you I want you I want you
Or I won't know where I am
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
When it becomes too much you'll shout aloud
Love to hear you say that love is love
There will be an answer
You say he loves you more than me
If you want money for people with minds that hate
A lifetime is so short
why can't you love me again?
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Always have clean shirts to play around in
And the only word is love
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Please
From this moment on I know
There were bells on a hill
She's a woman she's a woman
Hearing them seeing them
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And dig these rhythm and blues
Had a laugh and over dinner
We talked until tw
"I know you you know me"
And I can't spend my whole life tryin'
Well when Cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
Just cast an eye
It is being it is being
Dark is the sky
But they're not; we just wrote them like that
Towering over your head
I'll be writing more in a week or two
I don't want to leave her now
Something in the things she shows me
I love her and she's loving me
Tried to tell you how I'm cooking inside when we're cheek to cheek
I read the news today oh boy
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Ooh
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight
Hold me close and tell me how you feel
On his hobnail boots
Whoa whoa I mever realised what a kiss could be
Well you say that you need me like an ocean needs sand
Go to a show you hope she goes
one day the wind will blow and the sun will shine
Oh ain't she nice
I think of her but she only thinks of him
It's a little better all the time
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
He's as blind as he can be
Treasure these few words till we're together
if you'll be true to me
Some other guy now she was the first girl I ever had oh now
It's all too much for me to take
I saw her walk in your door
Well I'm the sheik of Araby your love belongs to me
Sweet little sixteen she's got the grown up blues
Well I said I'm sitting here watching matchbox hole in my clothes
But a one sided love I just don't understand
See the people standing there who Disagree and never win
And if you want some fun
Can't she see she'll be the only one lone one
Sexy Sadie is the greatest of them all
Tell me tell me tell me the answer
And your bird can swing
But tomorrow may rain so I'll follow the sun
She's in the mood no need to break it
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long
And I will take her out tonight
she's dressed in black
Since I heard from that girl of mine
I said we're traveling on the One after NineONine
Why why don't you open your heart?
Wigwam frightened of the dark
She done me good
One two three four
But it shows yes it shows
Wish I knew how you do it to me
Buy buy says the sign in the shop window
So many tears I was wasting
Always shouts out something obscene
Mr Moonlight
And we held each other tight
I don't know how you were diverted
You make me (shout)
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
and I say hello
And I hear them say
except for me and my monkey
You say yes (you say yes)
Remember what I said tonight
Having read the book
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Paperback writer paperback writer
Think of what you're saying
But I can turn away
Ooh! My soul
Oh what joy for every girl and boy knowing they're happy and they're safe
'Cos you walked hand in hand
It's getting better all the time
Gonna play my fiddle
Feeling two foot small
The future still looks good
Open up your eyes now tell me what you see
PS I love you
Alright hey hey hey hey (play the thing)
I got my eyes on you baby
No no this I can't believe
she eating twelve chapattis and cream
Girl I said I wish you were mine ah
How I hate to see you go
Everyone of us has all we need
Is whisper in your ear the words you want to hear
Each little dream will take wings
He's the all American bulletheaded Saxon mother's son
You're making me say that I've got nobbody but you
I say
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
Mummy don't worry your Teddy boy's here
They say it's your birthday
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I said I love a girl and Ruby is her name
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
Well here's another clue for you all T
What words I say or what time of day it is
Teddy don't worry your mummy's here mummy's gonna see you through
If there's something I have said or done
She's happy as can be
Molly is a singer in a band
my friend you're going to find her gone
she took me half the way there now
everybody let their hair down
There running my hands through her hair
But when you talk about destruction
I know little girl only a fool would doubt our love
So keep your hands off my baby
You you came just one dream ago
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
I've got to admit it's getting better
It's been a hard day's night
Not guilty for looking like a freak
So I sing a song of love Julia
You say you love me baby
Ooh did I tell you I need you
When you ask for money
Now Ted used to tell her he'd be twice as good and he knew he could 'cos in his head he said:
The Hendersons will dance and sing
I might have looked the other way
Well you know I love baby I'll never let you go
Until I do
So I must be on my way and face another day
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
I should have known better with a girl like you
And then the fireman rushes in
She said baby it's understood
I got to find a way to make you take me back
Always no sometimes
In spite of all the heartache
She made a fool of everyone Sexy Sadie
It's a thousand pages give or take a few
You don't know how lucky you lucky you are
Baby you're a rich man too
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
Always having dirt to play around in
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup
Cooking breakfast for the queen
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Be the only one Love me all the time girl we'll go on and on
seems that all I really was doing was waiting for you
Young Blood
Be thankful I don't take it all
And the stars
I'm gonna tell your Mama
All day long
I wish I knew if I knew
oooohhh Fool and his money
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
That my love told me now
Three cool chicks are walking down the street swinging their hips
And you'll be mine
Yes you now my name
I'm the lonely one As long as I can feel all right
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
 Don't want to spend
Joe Prairies and the Prairie Wallflowers
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet yeah
Hey Bungalow Bill
I don't like you
If you try to sit
that girl is mine
everybody knows I'm sure
Junior's head is hard as rock
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
But I just had to look
I'll come back for the honey and you
For well you know that it's a fool
So cry baby cry
I am the eggman oh they are the eggmen
Well you know that I love you tell the world I do
Hey hey hey hey
but I came back again I love you so
You know I can't sleep
Dee dee dee dee dee dee
Well I'm gonna change your mind
Telling me there'll be no next time if I just don't treat you right
Flowing more freely than wine
Here there and everywhere
Seems like all they really were doing was waiting for love
But I told you big fat bulldog
The movies gonna make me a big star
Her wall is filled with pictures she gets them one by one
Na na na na na na na
I'd get myself locked up today
I'm feelin' (shout)
We're going home
Say what're you doing in bed
Ain't got nothin' but love babe
t's driving me mad it's driving me mad
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
But he wants to be a paperback writer
picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
I'm an old poor boy and I'm a long way from home
As you are me
Coming on strong all the time
She's the woman gives me more more more
Come on give me fever put your little hand in mine girl
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Or play the game "existence" to the end
And the time will come when you see we're all one
Remember I'll always be true
I don't why you say goodbye
Someday when I'm lonely wishing you weren't so far away
A taste of honey
The last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye
Why tell me why did you not treat me right?
It's been a long long long time
She said baby can't you see?
They don't like him
We could hear the voices singing (I like it!)
Love can be deep inside love can be suicide
To you
Not a lot to say
When my life is through
Giving all your clothes to charity
Your lips are sweet I'd like to kiss them
and I want all the world to see
Marie is only six years old information please
'I think you know by now
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
The world is treating me bad misery
I say high (I say high)
the shop window
So I will set you free
I know that you saw me
My baby says she's traveling on the One after NineONine
if I knew how you do it to me
splitting up a bag of potatoe chips
You said you'd stay
Gonna have some fun tonight
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone
When you treat me so unkind
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
What a thing to do
she's my baby
Helter skelter Look out helter skelter
We're Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
where we met
So hold me tight let tonight be the night
Why must she be such a doggone tease?
'cos in his head he said: Mummy don't worry
Big and black the clouds may be time will pass away
oh oh oh oh
If you don't take her out tonight
for it's really gonna do you in
Oo my babe
When I hold you in my arms
And the more I go inside
What can I do and it's true
It's getting hard to be someone
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Soldier of love baby lay down your arms
I have always though that it's a crime
So come on come on come on
 Well I'm talking to you baby I'll never put you on
Lay down your arms of love and surrender to me yeah
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
anything you want me to
Why leave me standing here let me know the way
Sergeant Friday Peter Gunn and ooo Alan B
You know it's such a sight to see somebody steal the show
I never give you my number
So how could I dance with another
that I'd soon forget
Somebody new
And though we may be blind
Till they find there's no need (there's no need)
And it's true that it really only goes to show
And sip their lemonade
And Rocky said Doc it's only a scratch
You don't sound different
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do
Sunday morning you don't look right
See the hands amoving but I'm by myself
But it's my pride
Call me tonight and I'll come to you
'Til there was you
And though it's only a whim
As someone with a name
He never listens to them
Just like the flowers
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
And anytime you feel the pain
everybody had a good year
I'm begging her for kisses on my bended knees
One two three four five six seven
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
In my way
every single day of life?
Come on let me through
I just wanna dance with you all night

When I loved you
And though she feels as if she's in a play
You know it's up to you

Two of us riding nowhere
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
to hear you play your music till the sun goes down
I realize I have left it too late
You're not the hurting kind
So keep a rockin' that piano
If you leave me baby I don't know what I'll do

But I'll get you in the end
Didn't get to bed last night
Got no car and it's breaking my heart
With every mistake we must surely be learning

I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
And I'll send all my loving to you

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton

Look what you're doing
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Never glimpse the truth then it’s far too late when they pass away
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes I need you
Everybody's got something to hide
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies
But you can do something in between
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends

We all know obladiblada
Anyway you've always known the many ways I've tried
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
'Cos I been searching well searching oh my goodness
You don't need me to show the way love
When it's only a Northern song
Carolina may have Dina
writing the words of a sermon that noone will hear
I said I'm sitting here watching matchbox hole in my clothes
You won't forget her
About the good things we can have
Something in her style that shows me
'Cos you're making me feel like I've never been born
Is going away
There were birds in the sky
Every day
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
'm down (I'm really down)
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome I wish that I could die
Silently closing her bedroom door
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
With another man in my place
and I will treat her kind
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
I hope it's me and love love love
Hoo hoo oh And when I ask you to be mine
As I write this letter
Just what you mean to me
Expert expert choking smokers
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
Tell me what'd I say
Love love love Ooh! My soul

She acts as if it's understood
Each time I bring you a kiss I hear music divine
Baby's good to me
 'It's time for bed'
You and I have memories

So let it out and let it in
She never stops she's a go getter
You say you want a revolution
You know I hate to leave you oh oh
II meme mine

And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Would you lock the door
Now that I know what I feel must be right
Molly lets the children lend a hand
What a hard all time
Well look it over once or twice
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
But I don't think she's comin' home
Love love love
You know my temperature's risin'
And I I could see
I've got everything that you want
Why why says the sign in the yard
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
And then I might
But as from today
it seems so useless
In our yellow submarine
a little little honey don't
In the evening when the sun goes down
Yes she does
And keep you by my side
And nothing to get hungabout
If you only knew how much I love you why can't you love me
I'm doing the best that I can
You know I work all day
And if you ever say goodbye
If you wanna dance with me
Then you may find peace of mind is waiting there
wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
I think you'll understand
Yes I'm gonna break them in two
If she'll dance we can make it
I watched you walking by
And you know that your love is all you've got
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
I want you in the morning girl I love you
I'm nobody's child
I finally heard
Then we will remember things we said today
Everywhere it's like what you make for us
Holding you close to me
It was twenty years ago today
Turn me on when I get lonely
I will say the only words
This girl don't love me but I love her just the same
She wouldn't dance with another
Well mama she done told me papa done told me too
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
In my life I've loved them all
She brings to me
I suppose that you think you're very smart
To set you free girl
Without looking out of my window I could know the ways of heaven
You say and hold me
why can't you love me
He saw Aunt mary cummin' and he ducked back in the alley
And she said: Teddy don't worry now mummy's here taking good care of you
Not too commercial boys not too commercial!
We can work it out
that I will love you
It's been said she knocks them dead in any old town
Tell me why you cried And why you lied to me
don't make it bad
Well I don't care if the last thing I ever do in my life
I love you and all I want you to do
Sky of blue and sea of green
And I get to the bottom and I see you again
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
You just gotta call on me yeah you just gotta call on me
I'm wondering why
Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby baby
Oh you could find better things to do than to break my heart again
That I'll get you I'll get you in the end
There is one love I should never have crossed
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
A crowd of people turned away
Well mama's head has got to stop
And yet you don't believe her
You know how hard it can be
And I was born with a jealous mind
Tell me baby
Bull frog doing it again
yeah waiting for you
three cool cats are coming up in a beat up car
You don't take nothing with you but your soul – Think!
You're gonna give me everything
While my guitar gently weeps
Whoa oh these chains of love got a hold on me yeah
If I'm lonely too
Your mammie will scold
Because I feel the wind blow
She's good to me
Come on take it easy
Ha ha ha!
Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
every night when everybody has fun
But what I do is all too much for me to take
Hold your hand out you silly girl see what you've done
It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
You've really got a hold on me
dig it dig it
Baby now you're movin' way too fast
I feel hung up and I don't know why
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
Someday she'll see that she were meant just for me
It's gonna be a drag misery
But I'll come back someday
All these years I've been wandering around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
Threw the canary and you fed it to the neighbors cat
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold and the people
When I call you up your line's engaged
Just cause your trouble
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead
I'll be on my way ooh

I'll never let you down
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
Wipe the windows check the oil check the tires dollar gas?
That's all right my mama anyway you do
We take a walk the sun is shining down
yeah yeah yeah
But you were just the same
 Another day here
Writing fifty times
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
She's an angel sent to me
Well here's another place you can go Where everything flows
I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Some other guy now is makin' my past seem oh so bad oh now
Do you know any more?
Don't let me down
Ah here comes the Sun king
That is I think it's not too bad
I'd like to love you But darlin' I'm imprisoned by these
You want her you need her
way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Take out some insurance on me baby take out some insurance on me baby
After all this my love is up and must be leaving
And stops my mind from wandering
Holding me down turning me round
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
In my mind there's no sorrow
Maybe you'll let me walk you home
I mean everything I said
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna Man
I me mine
Seems that all I really was doing was waiting for love
I'm leaving town baby I'm leaving town for sure
that's how I know
I see no reason to change mine
Could see another kind of mind there
Well I talk about boys now
Remember to let her into your heart
My head is filled with things to say
Each day just goes so fast
Well I've got to learn to dance If it takes you all night and day
Oh yeah I'll tell you something
The more you give the more you get
There is something that you can't say
Well you know We'd all love to see the plan
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
Send her back to me 'cos everyone can see
So dearest one if you should leave me
Yes you celebrate anything you want
Clarabella Baby baby
In the pouring rain very strange
He said I'm gonna get that boy
Back in the US
You stick around now it may show
Yeah yeah yeah I mean Brown
Listen to me one more time how can I get through
Soon we'll be away from here
There is nothing I won't do
I think I'm gonna be sad
Love you when we're apart
If you say you love me too
Eleanor Rigby
But every girl I've ever had
Desmond says to Molly
From rocking and arolling spinning in a hula hoop
I'm a loser
No one you can save that can't be saved
My girl says when I kiss her lips
but that don't have Georgia Brown
Yeah the hippy hippy shake
And I'm doing the best that I can
Falling yes I am falling
Well I tried to
Will you won't you want me to make you
Yellow lorry slow nowhere to go
And wonder why they don't get in my door
And we held each other tigh
So we sailed on to the sun
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
yeah gimme money
Talking in our beds for a week
someday soon things will change and you'll be mine
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Well shake it shake it shake it baby now (shake it up baby)
Listen to me
Baby take a chance with me
And from your beam you made my dream
You say stop (you say stop)
I didn't know what I would find there
It's wonderful to be here It's certainly a thrill
Why why are you shy on love?
good morning
When I find myself in times of trouble
This bird has flown
But you can't hear me
Well look her over once or twice
It is not dying it is not dying
To get you money to buy you things
If just for your own sake
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
Two pound ten a week that was my pay
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
He helps you to understand He does everything he can Doctor Robert
monkey finger he shoot
Tell me what and I'll apologize
See how they run Like pigs from a gun
For she would never be free
The games begin to drag me down
Don't let him
You know I hate to see the sun sinking to the west
I ain't no fool and
Standing by a parking meter
And when at last I find you
You were perverted too
You know my name ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
She is happy just to hear me say
Leave me where I am I'm only sleeping
Don't forget me
You may think the band are not quite right
If the rain comes
But what I've got I'll give to you
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
No she's an angel sent to me
To where the winds don't blow
She knows how to shake that thing
Ooh then I suddenly see you
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
everybody pulled their socks up
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest
Born a poor young country boy
But she gets it while she can
So I will ask you once again
I thought I knew you what did I know?
They slither while they pass they slip away across the universe
It won't be long yeah yeah
I've lost her now for sure
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Can't you see ah
All you need is love love
You know how hard to think of
to take it's all too much
Shake it honey alright
I know your mind's made up
Some other guy now I just don't wanna hold my hand oh now
Now that you know who you are
it's a shame
I'm changing faster than the weather
'Cos I won't be there with you
You know you got me goin' now (got me goin')
I met you in the morning
Well I love you baby and you ought to know
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
Well I ask you very confidentially
The band begins at ten to six
Take a trip around the world
There is nothing else I'd rather do
I've been waiting here for you
I want that little chick
I can't forget the time or place
That boy isn't good for you
crying crying waiting waiting
It's too much
You're always wearing jeans except on sunday
Yes you can penetrate any place you go
And if I do I know the way there
You're gonna say you love me too hoo hoo
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free
I think about her almost all the time
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Don't look at me man I only had ten children!
My temperature is low fever is high I can't speak I'm too weak
Making love to only you
Yesterday
oh yeah You're my little girl
It's not so funny
Come together right now over me
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
I want that love of yours
You will be mine
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
With their whole fanclub standing there I mean sweet Georgia Brown
She's so glad she's telling all the world
No I never heard it at all 'Til there was you
Well there's gonna be a time
Thank you girl for loving me the way that you do (way that you do)
Think for yourself
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
You don't know what you're missing
where do they all come from?
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you
Take out some insurance on me baby ooo some insurance on me baby
over me
Be good Ted Alright
Every night?
Till I belong to you
I used to get mad at my school
Some other guy is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog oh now
It's a steady job
Send me a postcard
All your life
She wakes up she makes up
Oh yeah baby take a chance with me
We'll marry tomorrow
Promise you're always gonna be as sweet as you are
And I feel my finger on your trigger
You and me chasing paper
he turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry
 Don't want to stay here
It's the part of Liverpool
Don't pass me by
I need to laugh and when the sun is out
You say it's your birthday
Come on now (shout)
I'll tell ya I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
Shake it honey oh
My happiness still makes me cry
I said Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby won't you be mine? Oh
We're all alone and there's nobody else
The Magical Mystery Tour is waiting to take you away
Corporation teeshirt
And so it's true pride comes before a fall
I can see them laugh at me
I'll get you anything my friend
I say you will when you won't Aw aw honey don't
The celebrated Mr K performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate

Show you what your lovin' man can do
The sweat is gonna fill your head
She having all the ways good contacts

Honey pie
I'll never do you no harm
Remember to let her under your skin
Tuesdays on the phone to me
Hey Jude refrain
Believe me when I thank you ooo
When I see you everyday
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this
Well it's the second tim
But 'till she's here please don't come near just stay away
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
Well you know
And these memories lose their meaning
Find me in my field of grass
By the banks of her own lagoon
I know a jumping little joint
Because I pick a moon dog
But it's so hard loving you
I want you I want you so bad
Well I'll say bye bye
Salesman talking to me trying to run me up a creek
We would be so happy you and me noone there to tell us what to do
And before too long I fell in love with her
everybody's laughing everybody's happy
I would like you to dance – Birthday
And there's no time
I can stay till it's time to go
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Went out last night I didn't stay late
Carry your books home too
We'd like to thank you once again
She (We gave her most of our lives)
with the hippy hippy shake
Let me be your little dog till your big dog comes
See how they fly
For she would never be free when I was around
You better free your mind instead
Who is it for?
Come on pretty baby why can't you be true?
I never wanted to
Love you whenever we're together
Makes me weak in the knee
Bye bye baby I'm gone
Was she told when she was young the pain would lead to pleasure?
come on baby I want to be your loving man
For I have got another girl
Snap chicks cry they want to die when Georgie does the twist
And beggin down upon his bended knee
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
And I love her
Well I woke up this morning Lucille was not insid
See no future pay no rent
When I'm with her I'm happy
I've been searchin' for a girl
What am I to do
However big you think you are
that I will never leave her
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Three cool cats
However big you think you are Sexy Sadie
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
They can tell what he wants to do
That's bigger than my feet
Well if your hands start aclappin'
That I still love you so
I see my baby I get week in my knees
Same thing every day getting up going to school
Where did we lose the touch
boy you been a naughty girl You let your knickers down
Oh when I saw her standing there
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Wait till I come back to your side
Long distance information give me Memphis Tennessee
If there's anything that you want
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt ya
step inside love
Say you don't need no diamond rings
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out now
Already knows her ABC's
every day I've done nothing but cry
Remember that I'll always be in love with you
Could it be anybody
Come and show me the magic
 tonight Da da
Try to see it my way
It may sound funny
When I see you I just don't know what to say
His sister Pam works in a shop
That you are part of everything
Fella's sigh and even cry for sweet Georgia Brown
I love her
I'll try to make it shine
Oh you're giving me the same old line
I want my jockey to play
I'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see
Lay down your arms of love and love me peacefully yeah
And when my mind is wandering
Of the beginning Of the beginning
Wo wo yeah yeah
You know my heart so timed
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
There are places I remember
If you've got trouble
Well see her walking down that street
I am the eggman oh they are the eggman
Gonna find her gonna find her
Well I'm the sheik of Araby well I'm the sheik of Araby yeah
Baby what you're tryin' to do?
Clara Bella
bompa bom Look at me
And though I lose a friend in the end you will know
I can't forget that you told me so many promising lies
And the BBC BB king
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
that I'm about to lose my mimiind
She's got a ticket to ride
And the bag across her shoulder
Love me like no other baby
For red is the color my baby wore
He was such a stupid git
Just wait till I say
And eternally I'll always be in love with you
She says she loves me all day and night
Just like Dylan's Mr Jones
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
Na na na jamboree
Joan was quizzical studied pataphysical science in the home
to make that her body more thin
Because I told you before oh
Oh what you mean to me
You didn't run you didn't lie
But I thought you might like to know
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
Well tell your mama tell your pa
that Sgt Pepper taught the band to play
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you
Go go go little Queenie I said
But I am of the universe
Baby I'm determined
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Why can't she see how blind can she be?
It's all too much for me to see
rest your head on my shoulder and kiss me tonight
Love me all the time girl
She does for me oh
Hey bulldog (woof!)
take you today
One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover
tasting much sweeter than wine
And my friends have lost their way
She returned me to
As it's only a Northern song
'Cos every time you're gonna drive
Waits at the window
I'm taking the time for a number of things
So how come no one needs me
And why you lied to me
Waiting for the tides of time
Doesn't have a lot to say
holy roller he got
I made myself a promise
When I call her on the telephone
Wearing rings on every finger
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
Look into these eyes tell me what you see
man do you see what I see?
is to love love love her
And I told them where to go
and things
You may comfort me
Rattle and roll
 Oh oh oh
every little thing she does
Ah because the world is round it turns me on
yeah love me for ever
cry cry cry baby
and so it seems
A new one can't be bought
I don't really want to stop the show
Dream sweet dreams for you
Don't you worry 'bout a thing If you start to dance and sing
love let me turn down the light
And if you want me
Can't help myself 'cause baby it's you
Oh way out and blue
Don't bother me
Oh ain't that nice
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies
You were above me but not today
Talkin' about you (talkin' about you)
Who plays it cool
But if he loves you mo
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
Whoa love me do
she jumping as Mexican bean
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
you're going to lose that girl
Well that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Your mother's waiting for you
Money can't buy me love
All about the girl who came to stay?
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
Some forever not for better
When I get older losing my hair
I sit and meanwhile back
It's so fine it's sunshine
Make love singing songs
I'm goin' to make it I'm not that kind of man
Yes I know that she loves me now
In the beginning I misunderstood
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
I tried to telephone
Dance like a spinnin' top
I won't let you share what's mine
You're gonna cause more misery
Lonely wanna die
Knowing that love is to share
As we live a life of ease
And calls me on and on across the universe
Like the rain out of the blue
Yeah There will be an answer
don't make me cry
In a couple of years they have built
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I'll be there to make you feel right
oh One day you'll find that I have gone
Two of us sending postcards
Your day breaks your mind aches
Though tonight she's made me sad I still love her
You hurt me then
are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Give the word a chance to say
Can't run around 'cause I'm not free
so aw aw
look athere
She is anyway
Ow! If you want our love to last
But Daniel was hot – he drew first and shot
Saving up to buy some clothes
Try to find the party trying to get in touch with me
By leaving me a card or a letter
And if your heart's strong hold on I won't delay
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Everyone says there'll come a day when I'll walk alongside of her
Floating down the stream of time
Oh and this boy would be happy
Yes just to know know know her
oh I'll be there
If it takes me all night and day aw
Lift my head I'm still yawning
Nothing can come between us
Oo I can't keep still
Let me go on loving you
oh yea
Silly people run around they worry me
You better hurry 'cause its goin' fast
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
I think I got it off the writer
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
You'd better keep your head little girl
to make it all better better better better better better better ah!
I'm so tired I'm feeling so upset
Please mister postman look and see
Your only give me your funny paper
All those words they seem to slip away
Yeah I said bye bye baby
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
That she feel so tired of me
I saw the rising of the sun
Before your Mother was born
Army bunk army chow army clothes army car
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we'd fancy
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
Well on the way head in a cloud
Oh my darling
And don't you know that it's just you
every single day of my life?
Was I to blame for being unfair?
Well if you fell you like it
I come and love you daddy all night long
I'll never make it alone
It's only me it's not my mind
I only want what I can get
The stars that shine above will light our way to love
In the morning wanna die
In my life I love you more
Sexy Sadie oooh you'll get yours yet
This boy wants you back again
In your eyes
Bom bom bom bom bompa bom Sail the ship
everything has got to be just like you want it to
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Everybody!
As the Junelight turns to moonlight
I could feel my future fold
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
Where it will go
But I say it just to reach you Julia
You're quite contend to be bad
There I will go
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
It is not living it is not living
How to unfold your love I don't know how someone controlled you
cry cry cry
What you're doing to me
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
Then I'll say that something
And you know you should be glad
be in love with you
Another road where maybe I Could see
You know how I love you oh how much I love you
What do I do when my love is away does it worry you to be alone
Well you went up and married but I love you still
Lucille baby satisfy my soul
Well you gave me all your loving
Then I know that you will plainly see
There is still a light that shines on me
She's a woman who understands
Oh dear what can I do?
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
When we do the stroll
Missed things and kept out of sight
She gives me everything
Across the sea
Everybody (shout)
Sitting ona sofa with a sister or two
When I'm sixtyfour
And in the middle of the celebrations I break down
see her waters rise
She would not leave her number but I know who placed the call
no need to be afraid
Standing solo in the sun
And started playin' that that rock and roll music
It's my birthday too – yeah
and I say go go go
it feels like years since it's been here
Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye
I want somebody to love
And I want to be a paperback writer
I cry
Every day (heyayayay)
Just to love you but oh my yi yi
That's all I want to say
And all I gotta do is act naturally
If there's anything I can do
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
She gives me money everytime I need
A real cool way out sound
Norwegian wood
Waiting for my ya ya
and you tell me boldly
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
It's not too far back on the highway
'cos in his head he said: Mummy don't worry now Teddy boy's here taking good care of you
Bbbbb! if you want our love to last
Come on give me fever put your little hand in mine
I am the eggman oh they are they eggmen
Da da da da
If we close our eyes
That boy took my love away
I'd ask my friends to come and see an octopus's garden with me
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Closer let me whisper in your ear
Just one kiss then I'll go
And your bird can sing
Well up came that first cool cat he said: man look at that
Over men and horses hoops and garters and lastly through a hogshead of real fire
If you ever even try
Well you should see her in drag
The way you treat her what else can I do?
'Cos I've been in love before
don't make me blue
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
oooo
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
I can't get you out of my mind
Where I can go
oh yeah
Wait
I will always feel the same
You are so sweet and so near
That seemed to mean so much
Don't you know it's going to last
Rock and roll music
You say you're gonna leave you know it's a lie
He rollercoaster he got
And she's gone
They look just like two Gurus in a drag
They leave the West behind
She told him tales about a soldier dad but it made her sad
she's going to change her mind
And if you do I'll trust in you
A B C D
said we wish you success
Will make me feel alright
We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves
Well I gave you everything I had
Broken hearted jubilee
Well baby baby baby baby don't you know my love is true?
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
It's not always going to be this grey
Everybody everywhere
If it's funny try an' understand
like dreamers do
I could be happy with you by my side
Took her out and tried to win her
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Vera Chuck & Dave
I've got a word or two
You better leave me alone
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
Yes that'll be the day when you make me cry
she just treats me right
Yes you could say she was attractively built yeah
Keep your hands off my baby
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Never running in the streets
I can't conceive of any more misery
You say why
We all do what we can
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
If I catch you talking to that boy again
But you know there's always rain in my heart
Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Step inside love and stay
Tell my sister (heyayayay)
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
There she is again
Well I told you big fat bulldog you better leave her alone
and meanwhile Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
you are that girl in my dreams
Mister postman look and see
There's plenty there for everybody
Ok wail now oh yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
And donated to the National Trust
every day we'll be happy I know
No need for me complaining my objection's overruled
And from above you sent my love
Sing it again
Each and every day
My Michelle
I could never really live without you
all things must pass away
Well She's the one in the red blue jeans
I've got the hippy hippy shake
Love you all the time and never leave you
That is you can't you know tune in
Honey honey honey honey get off get off of that money
everybody's green
Grandchildren on your knee
Eating choc'late cake in a bag
I ain't had no real good loving since that woman said goodbye
I hope it will be mine
How do you do what you do to me?
One day you'll look and see I've gone
Every night (heyayayay)
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
Just like I want you
Use your arms for hold me tight
Now let me hold your hand
Then I will tell them I remember you
Not arriving on our way back home
In spite of all the danger
So come on come on
You're gonna say you love me too
I said I'm sitting here wondering matchbox hole in my clothes
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
The newspapers said
She's looking like the model
love you all the time
Noone was saved
When she says her love is dead
Falling in love again I never wanted to
She don't give the boys the eye
But the way that you hurt me I just don't understand
And when I wanna kiss you yeah
 I want to leave you
And all I gotta say is act naturally
I love you when you're mad at me
Help yourself to a bit of what's all around you
We're rockin' in two by two
Help me get in touch with her in Memphis Tennessee
we'd ever met
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Listen do you want to know a secret
I tried to find out what love is all about
When your lights have gone
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
from me If I needed someone
Tell me oh what can I do
Oh that sweet Georgia
I'm down (I'm really down)
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Make it easy to be near you
On Moonlight Bay (woo hoo!)
Oh no no no no this I can't believe
Lala how the life goes on
And when I do you better hide all the girls
All the cats want to dance with sweet little sixteen
Oh believe me darling
I really love you
Well work it on out honey (work it on out)
Love is the ceiling feelings are reelings free as the air
I'll remember all the little things we've done
I'm living for every moment girl for you
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Oh lord I'm searching my good lord searching you know honey
If you're listening to this song
yes
The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh
The one only Billy Shears
Don't want to kiss you
What are you going to play
But something sure is wrong
It's not the same but I'm to blame it's plain to see
Here comes the Sun king
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all I gotta do is thank you girl thank you girl
When I think of things you did it makes me wanna cry
Playing piano for the children of the king
you shake it to the right
And change the beauty of the melody
She looks as an African queen
Your song will fill the air
Any old dance that you wanna do
Is call you on the phone
Get home Loretta
I can see that I was blind
Whoa oh these chains of love won't let me be yeah
lost like some forgotten dreams
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
Whisper words of wisdom
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
Well come on pretty baby won't you walk with me?
Like the boys all play
float up stream (float up stream)
There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees yeah
I'll be better doc as soon as I am able
Somewhere in her smile she knows
She ought to think twice
spitting up a lift of candy bar
It's getting very near the end
As long as I can feel all right
Oh you shake
Please don't wear red tonight
got nothing child on me
Look out helter skelter helter skelter
Oh carry my love one
and maybe you will get a call
Did you have to treat me oh so bad
I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Ooh she does
It's just a one two three four five six seven eight nine wah
Gonna shake it up
will you still feed me
she was the top
The sun that shines above will light our way to love
Parachutes army boots sleeping bags for you
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Oh darling
So come on back and see
I'll make an early start
He wear no shoeshine he got
By making his world a little colder
as a bird on wings
Had it been another day
Tell them I remember you
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
Trying to make a dovetail joint yeah
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Love you forever and forever
A crazy stop she was the top
you're my baby
She's the woman walkin' that I know
What they need's a damn good whacking
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
While you see it your way
Some are dead and some are living
Roll up roll up for the Mystery Tour
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
Pride can hurt you too
Tell your Papa too
And Doris Day Matt Busby
See how they'll run
You might think the chords are going wrong
I think 'er no'
That I've been good as good as I can be
I said we're traveling on the One after Nineo
Become sweet sixteen and back in class again
Well that's all right mama yeah that's all right for you
He couldn't stand just to be around
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again teacher gets annoyed
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Don't want to cry when there's people there
and maybe you will get a call f
And then we lie beneath a shady tree
It's driving me mad it's driving me mad
Last night the wife said
Baby you can drive my car
To see how the other half live
Nobody but you (talkin' about you)
Thought I'd been in love before
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
searching every which away yeah yeah yeah
All over Saint Louis on down in New Orleans
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lill
Help!
Who gain the world and lose their soul
Of all the love I have won or have lost
just come on come on
The queen was in the playroom
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
Daddy our baby's gone
She's a big teaser
Well well well he'll make you Doctor Robert
fancy is free but are we bound to each other by love
Will never disappear I've seen that road before
Until the day I do love
All she needs is the stars up above
Helter skelter Look out cause here she comes
Uh oh many many many nights go by
My love is strong now
A love that should have lasted years
I think about you all the time
Since she came right it's a shame how she brings them down
Have you heard the word is love
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care
She does for me yeah
There's so many there to meet
Know that what you eat you are
I'll tax your seat
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
You know she's the kind of friend indeed
invites you to to just enjoy us
Yes she loves you
You were made to
Can't buy me love love
everybody put their foot down
Free As A Bird
So one day he walked in to town
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
Take it easy take it easy
She'll be knocking on my door
Why don't we do it in the road?
she tastes as Mongolian lamb
Let me hear you say
And of course Henry the Horse
She was a day tripper
I have never known the like of this
One thing I can say girl love you all the time
When you say she's looking good
Believe me when I tell you ooo
Everywhere I go I hear it said
When I think of love as something new
I cried it's through oh
You have found her
And I'll be satisfied
Good night
Oh no
and I love you tomorrow
You you know you know my name
leaving me alone
Oh! Darling please believe me
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Crying crying tears keep afalling all night long
when you call me like you do And I feel glad all over

oh you got to leave
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
She said you don't understand what I said
Mm I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
It feels so right now hold me tight
Help! I need somebody
I wish I knew

Now my advice for those who die
She won't desert me
I love you
I can't believe it's happened to me

So go away
Well with your lover by your side
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
And stars that dwell
Can't forget that you told me so many promising lies
sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
You stay home she goes out
Won't you please please help me?
Don't want nobody nobody 'cause baby it's you
Noone's frightened of playing it
It's gotta be rock roll music
My mother was of the sky
With love from me to you
But of all these friends and lovers
Lay down your arms of love and let the peacefully
She says: baby I'm all alone
One sweet dream came true today came true today
And the band begins to play
Son that gal you're fooling with she ain't no girl for you
Says you can buy it go on try it you can pay me next week
I say you're no clown
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
And if you start to swing and sway
Man I had I dreadful flight
oh I'm the one who wants you oh oh
Like a heart that's oh so true
Your inside is out and your outside is in
Well here's another place you can be
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true
So you might as well resign yourself to me oh yeah
You'll be thinking of me somehow I will know
I'm so in love with you
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Skies are as bright as your eyes the horizon is open
The more there is to see
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take it's all too much
I dont think it's funny
it seems like it's years since it's been here
I got no daddy's smile
You don't know how lucky you are
Day tripper yeah
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
I wanna hold your hand
As I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
still you tell me maybe
The Magical Mystery Tour is coming to take you away
is to find that little woman make her my wife
That I would love everything that you do
Home (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
I don't know why nobody told you
feet down below his knee
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Living in the world agree
Mailman bring me no more blues

none of life's strings can last
A little money
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
I'm her loving man
You know my name look up the number you now you know my name

Hey Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude yeah yeah!
Painting pictures for the children’s holiday
Whoa whoa I never realised what a kiss could be
'Cause I can play the part so well

And let me know that you're mine (let me know you're mine)
It's a love that has no past
After all this time I don't know why
When I get home Yeah
Now you're mine
grooving up slowly he got
It's a love that lasts forever
Someday when we're dreaming deep in love
It's so hard to reason with you
Now the sun turns out his light
Gee it's good to be back home
When I see you passing by
Well you can syndicate any boat you row
Dearest one if you should leave me
Filling me up with your rules
When you're here
The act you've known for all these years
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Make you love me more
Dreaming oh I'm only dreamin'
But this boy wants you back again
'Keep your hands to yourself'
Oh but tomorrow morning she'll have to change her trend
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band
Always made me feel soooo
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
they ain't sent him yet
But listen to the color of your dreams
When I saw her coming down the isle
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
'cos my love for you baby is the truest you've ever had
That love is all and love is everyone
Just to make you toe the line
I ain't got no matches but I sure got a long way to go
In the Isle of Wight
It has not always been this grey
Lends you a hand
Oh oh no
I should have known she would win in the end
The more it is it's too much
The love that's shining all around you
We're sitting here
People passing by used to stop and say
Oh oh oh
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
I wanna tell you pretty baby I think you're fine
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
Step inside love
Like I love only you
Here making each day of the year
Anna Just one more thing girl
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon baby now (come on baby)
One sweet dream
Red sails in the sunset Way out of the sea
and all along my heart was falling
Didn't anybody tell her
When you told me You didn't need me anymore
Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know
go out and get her
and whatever you want us to
You know she loves me sometime I leave
But when I saw him with you
dig it dig it dig it
Far as the eye can see
I'm gonna let you down
Well Charlie Chan Simon Smith
You know I believe and how
Nobody came
Don't ask me why She's a woman who understands
it's been a long cold lonely winter
I mearly died
Take your partners and don't see when you got it then let it go
And I held her hand in mine
In their eyes there's something lacking
What do you see when you turn out the light
I never needed anybody's help in any way
Make love all day long
Sha la la la la
Ooh and I want to hear me
See all without looking (See all without looking)
Ooh I love you
Sexy Sadie how did you know
I've got a chip on my shoulder
It's a little better all the time yes
Before I'm a dead old man
 I just can quit now
You could find better things to do than to break my heart again
Martha my love
I hardly knew the place
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing
You left me waiting here a long long time ago
with love from me to you
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Ah Run and tell your mama I want you be my bride
Spent my money then she plays me cool
Give me your answer fill in a form
You know I will
You made a fool of everyone
If you're feeling sorry and sad
Though I know I'll never lose affection
on the road to Mandalay
spinal cracker he got
Please remember how I feel about you
 Oo Lucille yeah baby do your sister's will
Well you know I nearly broke down and died
Because happiness is a warm gun
You know I feel okay
We are dead ah!
And chills come up on you
I'd really sympathize
Painting testimonial pictures
And don't bring your troubles to me
This dog is gonna get you if you don't leave her alone
Well it only goes to show
Understand I'll stay
But if I seem to act unkind
Love is here to stay
A little better all the time
Meanwhile I was thinking
You know my name better look up my number
Hey baby things are swingin' right
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Let me take you down
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Honeymooning down by the Seine
That I wanna (shout)
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
Stop and say 'Hello'
To be where you belong
So if we'll ever part and I'll leave you
Yeah I got a baby won't let me be
The lips I am missing
(you know I want to)
Well you should see Polythene Pam
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Take a sad song and make it better
Feel so suicidal
Standing in the dock at Southampton
You better leave my kitten all alone
You're telling all those lies
Shine until tomorrow
You can talk to me
And you know that can't be bad
since she came
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I say you're no clown Now now now now
Yes you can radiate everything you are
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
Well if you ever ever say goodbye I'm gonna walk right back and die
For so many years
And I will sing a lullaby
Well early in the mornin'
Be good to me
Honey don't
If you don't I really can't go on
On Moonlight Bay
Did she understand it when they said
Baby baby
Why why can't we love again?
They're gonna put me in the movies
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Good night sleep
Now I'll never dance with another
And when the night is cloudy
Is a little dark and out of key
And to see you're really only very small
But he knew it couldn't last
See how they run
Just a smile would lighten everything Sexy Sadie
If there's a letter a letter for me
There is no one compared with you
Dear Prudence won't you come out to play?
Why why says the junk in the yard
The other day I saw you
Come on Miss Lizzie
My inspiration
Deliver the letter the sooner the better
I never knew that a day like today lay before us
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue
The things you've said
But let's dance
We shall scrimp and save
Time after time you refuse to even listen
Who knows baby
Darling I love you
Well MrDog I'm gonna hit you on the top of your head
my hair is a mess
Ah look at all the lonely people
I may say yes
She could steal but she could not rob
Though the days are few they're filled with tears
Tried to please her
The higher you fly the deeper you go
Oh I am the walrus goog goog g'joob
Get on home Loretta
So cry baby cr
Try to realize it's all within yourself
Crying crying
I can't forget the spell that I'm in
And I say
You'd love her too
Don't know what it means to hold you tight
wo wo yeah uh
Oh baby baby baby
'Cause you know darling
Take your time don't hurry
I forgot to remember to forget her
and I'm not what I appear to be
Don't be sad just call me tonight
We're gonna have some fun
A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
Quiet boy quiet! OK quiet!
Woke up fell out of bed
I'll write home every day
Well I got a woman way across town
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
Yes you should see Polythene Pam yeah
I've got no kick against modern jazz
And he told us of his life
waited for the bliss
Remember that I'll always
Both of us thinking how good it can be
I'm gonna walk right over and die
Why do I always have to say love
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that
Red sails at the sunset
Oh daddy daddy I beg of you
When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
I'm down (down on the ground)
Leave it all till somebody else
records that she can get are records
that somebody well I'll be through
They're really rocking in Boston in Philadelphia PA
When I feel blue
When you are free
It's all too much
playing with their little toys
Just enjoy us
Out of college money spent
Ooo oo I say
No no no I'm so tired I don't know what to do
Across the universe
She said you hurt her so
If you get too cold
Don't be long don't be long don't be long
I know I'll often stop and think about them
He said: ta da da
He bag production he got
They look like angels from up above
When I get home
Once there was a way to get back home
And when I touch you
We meet the gang and go to rocking Joes
How could I ever have lost you
If I needed someone if I had some more time to spend
It's alright
you have changed your mind
I've got to learn to dance If it takes me all night and day
He blew his mind out in a car
It took me so long to find out
What can I do
Every night and day
Hey
Bye bye
Tell me love is real
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And it's worth it just to hear you say
no don't you ever change
You didn't need me anymore
Every summer we can rent a cottage
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
don't hurt my pride like her
you know She said so
Nobody knows just we two
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
you let her under your skin
Well I said shake rattle and roll
You know my name look up the number
Two of us wearing raincoats
Look around
she making with Apple an contract
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me that she's only foolin'
Oh oh to know know know her
She done me
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
Not guilty for getting in your way while you're trying to steal the day
He buys her diamond rings you know
Nothing had changed it's still the same
The folks dancin' got all shook up
too much monkey business for me to be involved again
Don't leave me all alone
told me she's no longer mine
Come on and work it on out (work it on out)
when you say
And when your big dog gets here watch how your puppy dog runs
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
It's you
What goes on in your mind?
so he left the town far away yeah yeah
You gotta gimme little lovin' gimme little lovin'
There must be some word today
Don't need to be alone don't need to be alone
I mean it must be high or low
All the money's gone nowhere to go
In the town where I was born
You just can't lose me
Oh you if you break my heart I'll go
All my life though some have changed
She kisses me and she holds me tight
Get back Jojo
Waiting to take you away
I been standing here waiting mister postman
She's killer diller when she's dressed to the hilt
When it comes to music Sweet Georgia is known to mind
And though she tried her best to help me
If somebody tries to take my place
Catch you with another man
But you can tell me 'bout the birds and bees
Do you promise not to tell Whoa
About a lucky man who made the grade
She (What did we do that was wrong) I
Will it bring you down?
You've really got a hold on me baby
Just call on us and we'll send it along
that you would love me more than her
With you every day
Childlike no one understands
but when it's time to make romance
Oh Carol don't let him
Little darling
So I lit a fire
what am I supposed to do
Day or night he'll be there anytime at all Doctor Robert
You said that you would be late an hour or two
I don't need a thing from you
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me?
Just to know that she loves me
would you promise to be true
Love you every day girl always on my mind
Going tell your mama you better do what she said
Dear Sir or Madam will you read my book
If you wear red tonight
You know I'll bring her in some day
We'll forget the tears we cried
To fill the Albert Hall
All the lonely people
Well I want that middle chick
And we are all together
Semoline pilchards climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Doctor Robert he's a man you must believe
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I say no (I say no)
Before this dance is through
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
I thought that you would realize
Help me information get in touch with my Marie
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
why why why
Na na na na jamboree
I know that you'll understand
I'm a loser and I'm not what I appear to be
That her baby buys her things you know
I left you far behind
I am on my knees beggin if you please
Too much monkey business too much monkey business
Well I just had to laugh
You say you've seen seven wonders
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one
And when the broken hearted people
Well half past nine half past four
The way things are going
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
That my love I can't hide
But you know I know when it's a dream
Everything will be alright
And he said: Mummy mummy don't worry your Teddy boy's here taking good care of you
I feel as though you ought to know
You give me a feeling in my heart
I used to think of noone else
Kissing you was fun honey
The sun is fading away
Buy buy Motorcars handlebars bicycles for two
I know you never even try girl
The thrill of it all
You're going to lose that girl
And there ain't nobody else around
The best little woman I ever had
That I don't need no other lover
I've been nervous and shook up too
and I do and I do
hoping hoping you'll come back baby
But to love her is to meet her everywhere
I stopped for just a little while to watch the children play
I'll always be true
And he never seems to notice
When I'm getting home tonight I'm gonna hold her tight
Free as a bird
Baby I don't want to fight no more
Don't you realize now what you see is me
In spite of you it's true
but thanks for the date
And got myself a steady job
All I gotta do Is call you on the phone
It's the next best thing to be
honey don't
Girl I want to marry you
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
And she said: Teddy don't worry your mummy's here taking good care of you
You feel like you gotta move around
That child is gonna miss you you gonna wish that you were dead
With a message at the local bird and bee
Dear Prudence open up your eyes
Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
You tell me it's the institution
When I came to your door no reply
And in the evening she's singer with the band
Dear Prudence like a little child
I'm so tired
Well let's dance well let's dance
I could see that National Health eyeball and I love you
He's gone she doesn't need him
Will the wind that blew her boat
it seems like years since it's been clear
Than just holding hands
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
of your Hollywood Song
Taking my time
Very bright
Where would I be without you
You say you're worried
You know my name look up my number you know
I'm in love for the first time
If it's a rocker that'll get it
then you won't be bothered with me hanging round your door
I'm crying I'm crying I'm crying
I wanna be famous a star of the screen
See how they smile
In a cap she looked much older
Lay down your arms of love and love me tenderly yeah
And nobody seems to like him
and maybe I'll love you
they have taken her away
But 'till she's here
I cried for you
He'd let us in knows where we've been in his octopus's garden in the shade
I said get out of that kitchen
Whoaoh yeah
With our love we could save the world if they only knew
Hey junior behave yourself
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
'Cos when I get you alone
I'll be good to her I'll make love to her
It's not like me to pretend
They'll fill you in with their sins
And though the news was rather sad
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
Sunset doesn't last all evening
yeah she say ya do (Bop shuop)
If you wanna dance with me If you wanna dance with me
is keeping perfectly still
When I feel that something
A home sweet home
you better leave her alone
mm mm you're my little girl
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
She no longer needs you
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
It's such a feeling
Show me that I'm everywhere and get me home for tea
Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door
Oh! Darling if you leave me
it's time to draw the line
Yeah that'll be the day
Ah because the wind is high it blows my mind
Well you can penetrate any place you go
dances the waltz
Don't need to be afraid
Didn't anybody see
And though you still can't see
Hey mama don't you see me wrong
Gonna send you back to Arkansas
I don't mind
Oo mercy I'm doggone and I'm happy and I'm glad all over
But it never really mattered
When you know I'm down?
Whoa oh love me do
They call me on and on across the universe
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
It could make a million for you overnight
You say you'll change a constitution
but sugar it's getting late
You love me too
Do you need anybody
Happy to be that way now that you've found another key
Tonight tonight

If I trust in you oh please
How does it feel to be one of the people
But I got a big surprise oh oh
Hey man save once chick for me
See how they fly Like Lucy in the sky
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
Until they sound just like a symphony
No I never saw them at all
everybody had a good time
She's got the devil in her heart
Use your arms for loving me baby that's the way it's got to be
You might not feel it now
Every morning when the sun comes up
I find the things that you do
darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
Taking my time lying there and staring at the ceiling
It's the word I'm thinking of
I dig a pony
And I do hey hey and I do
Way out of the sea
I didn't catch your name
The Magical Mystery Tour
Blonde hair goodlookingtrying to get me hooked and married
Take out some insurance on me baby mm some insurance on me baby
But I can't get through my hands are tied
All good children go to heaven
Alright hey hey don't do it right now
Well I used to walk you home baby after school
Run and tell your brother Baby don't run and hide
Look around round
we'll go on and on
But now I've got it the word is good
Biding my time
Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
Yes you can imitate everyone you know
Hold me tight
yeah that's all I gotta do
in the morning it will fade away
When I wake up early in the morning
Or should I say
When I'm alone
Do you don't you want me to love you
Well shake it up baby now (shake it up baby)
She thinks of him and she dresses in black
I know that she's no peasant
That'll be the day when you make me cry
'Cos I'm gonna see my baby today
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
Looking through a glass onion
Oh darling don't ever let me go
Things went bad I met her dad he said
Well baby save my fee
Listen to the music playing in your head
All my lovin I will send to you
don't be afraid
the homeward bounder dirty no good robbin'
Why should I feel the way I do?
I said that's all right I'm waiting here just waiting to hear from you
Everyone you see is half asleep
And I'll forgive the lies that I
How can I ever misplace you
There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees
boys Back in the car
Arrive without travelling
And just like for the other kids it will be a home for me
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
So go away leave me alone don't bother me
I'll tax the street
Well I beg you on my bended knees
I’m glad it's your birthday
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Do what you want to do
I wake up to the sound of music
Thinking of you
It is believing it is believing
You don't know the latest dance
Take your partner and don't hold them tight and don't let go
Something in the way she moves
don't bother me
Sweet Georgia Brown
You'll be mine and I know
All the world is birthday cake so take a piece but not too much
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Oh when this girl looks at me she just sets my heart aflame oh
I should be sleeping like a log
That girl is gonna miss you you gonna wish that you were dead
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
And know that you will wait for me
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Tell me I'm the only one
And she keeps calling me back again
But I must come to run honey
And things you do
if it's not too dear
But like you heard me said: not guilty
Please Remember me
Meanwhile I was still thinking
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
I turn around it's past
I nearly died
You'll never know how much I really care
And I do appreciate you being around
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
if I needed someone
My love don't give me presents
Some other guy now is makin' me very very mad oh now
There lingers still 'though we're far apart
If you want it here it is come and get it
You can't be as worried as me
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Drinking her wine
ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
So important to me
Oh I can't sleep at night since you've been gone
Everybody seems to think I'm laz
Ah rock on Anybody
Here I am sitting all on my own
Nowhere man please listen
Baby baby baby baby don't you know I want a lot
So let me see you smile again
Oh this joy is something new
Misunderstanding all you see
And after all
you you you
Please don't be long or I may be asleep
Like she do me
Any old way you choose it
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Come on is such a joy
She's leaving home after living alone
I say you will when you won't aw aw honey don't
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
That you would want me too
You tell that you've got everything you want
Listen can't you see
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been
I said shake rattle and roll
Then you got less trouble than me
Don't ever leave me alone
I'll give you all I've got to give
Clarabella
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewellers' stores
and I'd have never been aware
Shine the weather's fine
You're talking that way
Look around round round
You know what to do
If you don't treat her right
Mother Mary comes to me
I'm gonna search this town from door to door
And the banker never wears a mac
Baby hurry don't keep me worry
That's all right that's all right
You're coming home you're coming home
When I cannot sing my heart
So hold me tight and let tonight be the night
And he wants you all to sing along
She'll never hurt me
Hallelujah I just love her so
There's a shadow hanging over me
And that she will cry when she learns we are two
Long as she's got a dime
yeah I tell you you've changed
good day sunshine
you're the only one
but I've found out somehow
It's easy! Ooh!
And life flows on within you and without you
And if you saw my love
And I'll be better
You've broken my heart gonna do it again
Who looked like you
Even hate my rock and roll
And your bird is green
I don't know I don't know
That's all right
You ask me for a contribution
Hold me tight don't you let me go
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
Love will find a way?
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Lady Madonna baby at your breast
I want you to stay
'Cause I couldn't really stand it I admit that I was wrong
Only place that he's ever been
And looking up I noticed I was late
Sail across the Atlantic
Can I have a little more
like a rolling stone
Just to see her smile makes my life worthwhile
Love has always been my game
Here I stand with head in hand
I want you I want you so bad I
You know she winks like a glow worm
Ah
But I've found a driver that's a start
Being here alone tonight with you
Aw too much monkey business too much monkey business
If you are down he'll pick you up Doctor Robert
Well come on honey Bonnie give me one more time
Who knows how to love me (talkin' about you)
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Loving you is the natural thing to do
You treat me badly
Hela heba helloa
And please say to me
(Roll up) and that's an invitation
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
Until I find a way
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
Oh please say to me
It's way to early for a congo
just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge
So if you want me
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
She almost lost her mind
Bebopalula she's
Can you hear me that when it rains and shines
People tell me I'm lucky
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
There's one thing you don't touch
Then I will tell them I remember
Sheep dog standing in the rain
I'm only sleeping
Sunday driver yeah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh we danced through the night
How must I forget these lonesome tears in my eyes?
There ain't no reason for you to be bad for you're the woman and I love you so
My baby doll my baby doll my baby doll
I cried for you yeah
Sitting here la la
You you know you know my name baby
Can't stop thinking about her now
The clouds will be a daisy chain
You know they didn't even give us a chance
There's a fog upon LA
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
Please don't be long please
Well now Clara Bella
Gonna talk (heyayayay)
I must not be so
So we can move on out
In their styes with all their backing they don't care what goes on around
but he could play his guitar just like aringing a bell
your Mother should know
My baby don't care my baby don't care
Ooh I need your love babe
That if I ran away from you
And now you've changed your mind
But you don't get me
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
You say goodbye
And you know what it's worth
Because the sky is blue
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
True love didn't last long
Nobody was really sure
Come on honey Bonnie give me one more time
Don't you run and hide
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
In the state I'm in
And tenderly
Like the FBI and the CIA
Monday morning turning back
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Please please me oh yeah like I please you
So important to you
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
Resting our head on the sea bed in an octopus's garden near a cave
If he was from the House of Lords
Then we'll have some fun when you're mine all mine
Well if you want to hear some music
Nothing to do
Dragged a comb across my head
You can see them out for dinner with their piggie wives
Come on (shout)
bye baby bye bye
I haven't slept a wink
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Because the world is round
Now that I know you won't leave me no more
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
She sailed at the dawning
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah!
Yes you'll have to have them all pulled out after the savoy truffle
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Although your mind's opaque
I beat her and kept her from the Things that she loved
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Oh if you want me baby you got to come to me
Back to where you once belonged
Cry baby cry
Can we really live without each other
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
Gideon checked out and he left in no doubt
Oh how you can hurt me I just can't understand
'Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
If there's anything we can do
Nowhere Man don't worry
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Mummy don't worry now Teddy boy's here
And now the thought of meeting you
Gives me all her time as well as lovin'
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
But if your heart breaks don't wait turn me away
That I know that
Your day breaks
And keep you satisfied
This is what I said tonight
Does it mean you don't love me anymore?
in spite of all that may be
I feel happy inside
Yes I will I'll get you in the end
'Cos they play so loud
Made the bus in seconds flat
bompa bom Skip the rope
Don't let the heat overcome you
And arriving late for tea
I've got lips that long to kiss you
Well gonna write a little letter G
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
All my little plans and schemes
When you call my name Ooo
I been told when a boy kiss a girl
mmmmmm make your mind up fast
Speaking words of wisdom
She's a woman who loves her man
Till I walk out that door again
Sail me on a silver sun
I don't kow who can
I'm so tired my mind is set on you
So oh I should have realised a lot of things before
Trying to get to Holland or France
Many people coming from miles around
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Sit beside a mountain stream
A taste of honey tasting much sweeter than wine
Say the word and be like me
Now they know how many holes it takes
 I think it's a sin
Come on and enjoy us
I said you're my baby
She's got a ticket to ri hi hide
So hold me tight
We were talking about the space between us all
Nothing's gonna change my world
Love me for ever
You don't realize how much I need you
Same old thing happens every day
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
I only send you my invitations
Life is very short and there's no time
Nowhere Man the world is at your command
You'll rule this world with me I'm the sheik of Araby
Saying she's returning home to me
Something inside that was always denied
No I never heard it at all
Roll it over and move on up
Well the day she went away
That's all right mama just anyway you do
Take a good look you're bound to see
That's the kind of love love that is too good to be true
I'm looking through you where did you go?
I can never win
I've got no time for you right now don't bother me
We'd all love to see the plan
So may I introduce to you
Until that day Don't come around leave me alone
You should hear what they say about you "cheat" "cheat"
It's alright (heyayayay)
Well try someone softer instead
What's been wrong with you
oh like dreamers do
Well gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme all the love you got
Well you can celebrate anything you want
The wind is low the birds will sing
Noone comes near
I don't want to sound complaining
Sunday morning go for a ride
Ask me why
Till you die
here it comes
You let your face grow long
I've got my bag Run to the station
Aah Johnny B Goode!
Little child won't you dance with me?
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
I'm not trying to pretend
She says she loves me just for me yeah
Yes we're going to party party
for it's gonna do you in
That Georgia's always on my mind
hoping hoping
but I haven't a clue
And I'm not what I appear to be
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
Mother Nature's son
hello little girl
Paperback writer
She's the kind of a girl that makes the News of the World
of the velvet hand Like a lizard on a window pane
You've been good to me you made me glad when I was blue
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day
how blind can she be?
oh One day you'll look and see I've gone
Sgt Pepper's lonely
And shake those pots and pans
For though they may be parted there is
They said you were not home that's a lie
Do the hippy shake shake with all of your might
All the children sing
he grooving such cooky spaghetti
And in her eyes you see nothing
Be the only one
That's why I know yes I know
joojoo eyeball he one
You became a legend of the silver screen
I'll let you know when she's come home
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know
I won't see her no more
If I love you too oh please
Beep beep mm beep beep yeah
When you see me in misery
and you know the things she does
I don't know what I'll do
How can I even try
But I can show you a better time
You still moan
And help me understand?
Still a chance that they will see
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
So many tears I was searching
everywhere people stare
Nobody in the world can do what she can do
Baby says she's mine
Well they love like angels from up above
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Harmony come on and enjoy us
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Steal your heart away
When I'm in the middle of a dream
How I want you
But as she's getting ready to go a knock come on the door
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
The cats are something on the heels and toes
So I can gear some of that
Stating point of view
No use handing me a writ
For a seance in the dark
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
Silver hammer man
I got no mummy's kisses
Well he put some tacks on teachers chair
You say you will love me if I have to go
Night gonna be
'Cos I will treat her right
Well at night where you're asleep into your tent I'll creep
Oh won't you give me some of your loving
Late night all alone with a testtube
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
Good night sleep tight
What's that boy? (woof!)
but won't you tell me how do you do it?
I could wait for ever
Mama don't worry your Teddy boy's here
I still love her all over
And you'll come running home
It's only love and that is all
Man buys ring woman throws it away
Nowhere Man please listen
In summer meanwhile back
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
You looked at me that's all you had to
She says she loves me early in the morning just for me
 I think I'll let you down
What did you kill
I said no no no you're wrong
Say you do baby when you don't Let me know honey how you fell
For some California Grass
I'll be good like I know I should
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again
I once had a girl
Put on especially by the children for a lark
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
It always made me feel so
let it be
Standing alone at the top of stairs
When I try to catch your eye
Honey pie you are making me crazy
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
Coming to take you away
I've got somebody that's new
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
I'll be on my way
She's just the girl for me
Takes him out to look at the Queen
She's leaving home bye bye
If I walk you home
Yeah the goosepimples baby 'cos I feel so good
Oh oh oh oh
Now it's time to say good night
and I say I don't know
Oh oh
I'm filling in the cracks that ran through the door
They're gonna make a big star out of me
It's all right
You give back your ring to me
It is shining it is shining
talking on about how sharp they are
And now she says she knows
Mother Superior jump the gun
That's why I know that's why I know
For the benefit of Mr Kite there will be a show tonight on trampoline
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
She's the woman walk around the store
Tell my why?
I been waiting such a long time
Any old time you use it
don't you ever change
And I just can't go on
that I will love her
That weren't important yesterday And I still go
Ain't got nothing to lose
All you need is love
They might as well be dead
And we lived beneath the waves
Baby I'm in love with you
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
So Captain Marval zapped him right between the eyes
Meeting a man from the motor trade
Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
She's the woman that loves me so
She's my baby and I love her so
If you need a shoulder to cry on
I used to be cruel to my woman
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
It took a long long long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
Oh mommy mommy please may I go
Anna You come and ask me girl
I don't care too much for money
We'd all love to change your head
She said: Teddy don't worry your mummy's here Teddy's gonna see you through
I got a woman way across town
and now I know
Through my open mind inciting and inviting me
I'm so happy when you dance with me
That the word is just the way
Well if you leave me baby
When I think about you I can say
Ooh you were meant to be near me
And Mr H will demonstrate
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
I know what it's like to be dead
everybody tells me so
drumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
They're going to crucify me
I knew when you first said hello
Twist and shout (twist and shout)
It's the word love
I've imagined I'm in love with you
over you
Well I've got to learn to dance
Say that you'll always be mine
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
We would be warm below the storm in our little hideaway beneath the waves
Black cloud crossed my mind
And you can thank her ma'am
The duke was having problems
I'm crying
oh oh oh
I can only speak my mind Julia
The Magical Mystery Tour is hoping to take you away
Oh no no no this I can't believe
But I can't so I'll cry instead
Hope you need my love babe just like I need you
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
Yeah I've got a feeling yeah
when Mr K performs his tricks without a sound
Especially when you're standing there
(Roll up) to make a resvation
She said so
Tell me oh what can I do?
Come on you can do with baby come on and join
You'd better watch your step now
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
Yeah I'm the Taxman
And three cool chicks made three fools out of three cool cats
We were talking about the love we all could share when we find it
 I asked her friends about her but all their lips were tight
Martha my dear though I spend my days
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song that was a hit
always on my mind
I don't want you
Hey Jude
And IIII oh I'll be there yeah
You'll never know how much I really love you
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Got the bill and Rita paid it
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
Free
Your voice is soothing but the words aren't clear
The less one knows
And from the world you sent my girl
If I'm true I'll never leave
Have 'em ball tonight
Ain't she sweet?
Happiness is a warm gun
Lay down your arms of love and love me peacefully
 I want to split now
He won't do nothing right just sitting down and looks so good
But I saw you peep through your window
Wondering how come nobody told me
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again
Please don't ever change
you will know what I mean
Should you need a love that's true it's me
Love was such an easy game to play
yeah You're my honey
Lucille baby do your sister's will
And you're making me feel like I've never been born
No one alerted you
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
Turn off your mind relax and float downstream
I can show you
Well darling all the night
but in my heart I wanted more
Whoaho whoaho I got a whole lot of things to tell her
And had you gone you knew in time
Ooh ooh ooh
If I find her I'll be glad I still love her
Three cool chicks
I saw her standing on the corner a yellow ribbon in her hair
Stumble blindly as they make their way
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long
Say I got a woman way across town
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
Chains chains of love
They said that you were not home that's a lie
If you want me to
But I love you
Took her home and nearly made it
If this is love you;ve got to give me more
Been away so long
This could only happen to me
It's too much Ah!
Use your imagination
She hates to see me cry
And I will take her out tonight and I will treat her kind
I tried to talk but I just stuttered:
 Do I have to tell you one more time
And you're working for noone but me
I need your baby oh so bad
The best things in life are free
If I could see you now
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggie lives
I say this group is absolutely marvellous with the piano don't you think so
Oh oh these chains of love got a hold on me
joob goog goog g'joob
What you're doing to me?
Oh carry my loved one
This way will I go
I can't help it
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Wearing her highheel shoes
All together now!
Let it be let it be
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors
my mind is on the blink
I'm gonna talk
And I will lose my mind
We all want to change the world
I call your name but you're not there
The Hendersons will all be there late of Pablo Fanques'fair what a scene
how you do it to me
Say we'll be together every day
Don't you know it's going to be all right all right all right
If you drive a car
I may not have a lot to give
