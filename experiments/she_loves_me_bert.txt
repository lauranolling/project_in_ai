tom had better help himself falling in love ah
ah ah ah

tom had better help himself falling in love ah
ah ah ah

She's there and these are tears that hurt her feelings as
come on quick as possible
looking so beautiful and f ##ed and tearing it up jazz
the impossible

the impossible

impossible impossible impossible
